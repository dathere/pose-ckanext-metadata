The data must be published raw (unprocessed), well-structured, and in known formats that facilitate reuse. On the other hand, there is the concept of Re-use of Public Sector Information. According to Law 37/2007, of November 16, on the re-use of public sector information, re-use is understood as the use of documents held by Public Administrations and public sector bodies, by natural or legal persons, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that such use does not constitute a public administrative activity. Excluded from this concept is the exchange of documents between Public Administrations and public sector bodies in the exercise of the public functions assigned to them. Although they are similar terms since they refer to the publication of data in open formats to promote re-use, Open Data has a global scope, establishes the requirements on how the data should be published, and does not contemplate payment for the use of the data. On the other hand, the Re-use of Information in the public sector limits its scope to this sector and, according to Law 37/2007, contemplates the possibility of applying a fee or public price, in addition to not being as rigorous in how the information should be presented. The public sector produces a wide variety of information of interest to citizens and businesses, such as social, economic, geographic, statistical, meteorological, or tourist information, and information about companies and education. This information has characteristics that make it particularly attractive to the digital content sector, as it is complete, reliable, and of high quality. The opening of public sector data allows any person or organization to build on them a new idea that results in new data, knowledge, improved processes, added value to existing ones, or even the creation of new services. Therefore, it has considerable economic potential and also promotes transparency, participation, and citizen collaboration, necessary for a more open government. The provincial open data portal is an action framed within the Digital Rural Community project, co-financed by the ERDF as an integral part of the POCTEP (Cross-border Cooperation Operational Program Spain-Portugal). The project aims to create a stable structure of cooperation between cross-border local administrations to promote innovation and administrative and territorial modernization. To achieve this objective, a continuous innovation network is promoted among cross-border local entities, a platform of innovative solutions for electronic administration and smart government is developed, and a joint training program in innovation and the use of ICT is developed for citizens, companies, local public employees, and ICT technicians of local public administrations. The partners of the Digital Rural Community are the General Directorate of Telecommunications of the Department of Development and Environment of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, REGTSA, the Provincial Council of Valladolid, and the Portuguese Municipal Chambers of Almeida and Sabugal. The objectives of the open data portal are to promote the public availability of data held by public administrations and that are of interest to citizens and to the infomediary sector, through the implementation of a strategy and a provincial open data portal, improving transparency and enabling the generation of value through the development of new services based on them. This action not only has an impact on the economy but can also contribute to the development of an active citizenry and contributes to making the principles of new governance effective in Public Administrations.\n\n*Translated from Spanish*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nDatos abiertos (open data en ingl\u00e9s) es una filosof\u00eda y pr\u00e1ctica que persigue que determinados datos est\u00e9n disponibles de forma libre a todo el mundo, sin restricciones de copyright , patentes u otros mecanismos de control. Los datos deben publicarse en bruto (sin procesar), bien estructurados y en formatos conocidos que faciliten la reutilizaci\u00f3n. Por otro lado existe el concepto de Reutilizaci\u00f3n de la Informaci\u00f3n en el sector p\u00fablico. Seg\u00fan la Ley 37/2007, de 16 de noviembre, sobre reutilizaci\u00f3n de la informaci\u00f3n del sector p\u00fablico se entiende por reutilizaci\u00f3n el uso de documentos que obran en poder de las Administraciones y organismos del sector p\u00fablico, por personas f\u00edsicas o jur\u00eddicas, con fines comerciales o no comerciales, siempre que dicho uso no constituya una actividad administrativa p\u00fablica. Queda excluido de este concepto el intercambio de documentos entre Administraciones y organismos del sector p\u00fablico en el ejercicio de las funciones p\u00fablicas que tengan atribuidas. Aunque son t\u00e9rminos similares pues se refieren a la publicaci\u00f3n de datos en formatos abiertos para favorecer la reutilizaci\u00f3n, Datos Abiertos tiene un \u00e1mbito global, establece los requisitos sobre c\u00f3mo deben publicarse los datos y no contempla el pago por el uso de los datos. Por otro lado la Reutilizaci\u00f3n de la Informaci\u00f3n en el sector p\u00fablico limita su \u00e1mbito a este sector y, atendiendo a la Ley 37/2007, contempla la posibilidad de aplicar una tasa o precio p\u00fablico, adem\u00e1s de no ser tan riguroso en c\u00f3mo debe presentarse la informaci\u00f3n. El sector p\u00fablico produce una gran variedad de informaci\u00f3n interesante para los ciudadanos y empresas, como por ejemplo, informaci\u00f3n social, econ\u00f3mica, geogr\u00e1fica, estad\u00edstica, meteorol\u00f3gica o tur\u00edstica y sobre empresas y educaci\u00f3n. Esta informaci\u00f3n tiene unas caracter\u00edsticas que la hacen particularmente atractiva para el sector de los contenidos digitales, ya que es completa, fiable y de calidad. La apertura de datos del sector p\u00fablico permite que cualquier persona u organizaci\u00f3n pueda construir sobre ellos una nueva idea que resulte en nuevos datos, conocimientos, mejorar procesos, dar valor a\u00f1adido a los existentes o incluso crear nuevos servicios. Por lo tanto, tiene un considerable potencial econ\u00f3mico y adem\u00e1s favorece la transparencia, participaci\u00f3n y colaboraci\u00f3n ciudadana, necesarios para contar con un gobierno m\u00e1s abierto. El portal provincial de datos abiertos es una actuaci\u00f3n enmarcada dentro del proyecto Comunidad Rural Digital, cofinanciado por FEDER como parte integrante del POCTEP (Programa operativo transfronterizo de cooperaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1a- Portugal). El proyecto tiene como objetivo crear una estructura estable de cooperaci\u00f3n entre administraciones locales transfronterizas para fomentar la innovaci\u00f3n y modernizaci\u00f3n administrativa y territorial.

The registrar assigns related agencies to carry out the registration and update of farmer information. Each agency designs its own datasets and develops specific systems for use to facilitate the work of officials who are distributed throughout the country. Data is linked with other agencies under the government's Thailand 4.0 policy, which aims to connect government agencies to each other, upgrading them to a Digital Government to assist in the administration of public services (e-Public Service). The central farmer database (Farmer ONE) is a large agricultural digital data center (Big Data) that creates government services through internet technology, which has come to replace traditional working methods. It integrates data between agencies (Government Integration) from the units responsible for registering and updating farmer information, in order to achieve effective control and management, including agricultural households, individual farmers, and other related data. This data is stored in a standard structure for agricultural data exchange (Agriculture Data Exchange standard dataset: ADX dataset), newly designed to be capable of storing data from multiple agencies into a single database, in accordance with the Data Governance for Government regulations. It operates with technology and innovation that has undergone advanced research and development, installed on the Government Data Center and Cloud services (GDCC), and works with the Government Information Network (GIN). This data is used to support the decision-making of national and local executives. In the future, some data may be made available to the private sector for use in planning and driving assistance to farmers in the event of disasters and assistance under various projects and measures. This comprises: 1. Department of Agricultural Extension: Registration of crop farmers; 2. Department of Fisheries: Registration of aquaculture farmers; 3. Department of Livestock Development: Registration of livestock farmers at the household level; 4. Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture: Registration of mulberry growers, silkworm raisers, and silk weavers; 5. Rubber Authority of Thailand: Registration of rubber plantation farmers; 6. Office of the Cane and Sugar Board: Registration of sugarcane farmers; 7. Thailand Tobacco Authority: Registration of tobacco farmers. Furthermore, Farmer ONE is also used to integrate data with the Targeted Poverty Mapping and Management System (TPMAP) in all 5 dimensions of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC), to analyze in-depth big data (Big Data and Analytics) to identify vulnerable farmers. This is used to create data maps that can comprehensively, accurately, and promptly address the needs, and is used to plan and determine measures to drive assistance to vulnerable farmers, promoting equality accurately and achieving clear results. Related agencies use it to promote according to the country's development goals: 1. Security; 2. Enhancing competitiveness; 3. Developing and strengthening human resource potential; 4. Creating opportunities and social equality; 5. Creating growth on quality of life that is environmentally friendly; 6. Balancing and developing the public sector management system.\n\n*Translated from Thai*\n\n---\n\n**Original

Adverse experiences early in life can produce important physiological changes, which become embedded biological traces leading to increased vulnerability for later depression. There is now robust evidence indicating that early metabolic challenges impinge upon energy balance regulatory systems, which, in many cases, overlap with stress-response systems. EMBED will identify informative DNA methylation differences associated with prenatal psychological and metabolic stressors in genes that are relevant for mood disorders. These will be related to shared biomarkers to define common biological substrates between early life stress and maternal obesity for prevention and treatment. We will also determine whether intervention strategies can reverse such epigenetic marks and related biomarkers. The relationship between DNA methylation pattern in human peripheral samples (cord blood) and brain will be studied in animal models and brain post-mortem samples from depressive patients. EMBED brings together leading researchers with complementary expertise to exploit existing clinical data sets, including biomaterial collections from previous collaborative proposals, that will be analyzed in an original and innovative way to study the role of different, but often co-occurring, adverse prenatal conditions on individual risk/resilience to develop mental disorders in adulthood. This research may lead not only to a better understanding of the risk architecture of major psychiatric disorders, but could also enable preventive measures in risk populations, new diagnostics and, potentially, therapeutic approaches since, in contrast to genetic variations, epigenetic effects on the transcriptome may be reversed, also in adulthood.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [153.0235009, -27.4689623]}, "properties": {"id": "6447831a-6cf5-4954-b867-99b55236fb3a", "name": "gsq-open-data-portal", "title": "GSQ Open Data Portal", "url": "https://geoscience.data.qld.gov.au", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/gsq-open-data-portal", "state": "active", "description": "About GSQ\nThe Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) plays a key role in improving understanding of Queensland\u2019s resource potential and attracting exploration and investment in the resources sector.\n\nGeoscience Data Modernisation Project\nGSQ's Geoscience Data Modernisation Project (GDMP) seeks to unlock the value of geoscience data to enable industry success.\n\nData quality\nAs we publish our open data through this portal, you may encounter data quality issues.

This aims to spark creativity among students, researchers, developers, and those interested in using the data to further develop and extend its utility endlessly, in accordance with the intention of creating Open Innovation with Open Data. Open Data is data in a Machine-readable Data format that is open for use without charge (Open License). Recognizing the increasing importance of Open Data, govtech.in.th will serve as another channel, acting as a central hub to support the provision of open data from both the public and private sectors, providing a channel to publish Open Data sets. A key feature is that the data published through this website will be automatically converted into a RESTFul API (Application Programming Interface). It emphasizes providing those interested in Data Science with tools to support data analysis and report creation in various types of graphs (Data Visualization tools) from open data, such as creating graphs for time-series data and heatmaps for spatial statistics data at the provincial, district, and sub-district levels of Thailand, using a drill-down method on a hierarchical map (treemap). -- About Platform: It focuses on enabling users who are application developers to access data in each dataset through an API (data API), which will allow application developers to access data more flexibly compared to disclosing data in excel or CSV spreadsheet files that application developers have to download each file and process it themselves. It focuses on enabling users who are researchers or data analysts to flexibly analyze and visualize open dataset data (data analysis and visualization) through the website and be able to publish the analysis results in graph form via online media (data visualization sharing) or incorporate them into articles on web pages (data visualization embedding) with greater flexibility compared to disclosing data in excel or CSV spreadsheet files that researchers or data analysts have to download each file and analyze the data themselves through external programs. It focuses on enabling users who are data publishers to disclose data in a way that can be easily used and further developed (improved data accessibility). Data publishers can prepare data in CSV spreadsheet files, and the system will automatically convert the data so that users can access it in the ways mentioned in points 1 and 2. In addition, the CSV data file will be checked to ensure that it is in a suitable table data format (dataset validation). If the check passes, it means that the dataset is in a machine-readable data format. If it is not in a suitable format, it will not be able to be imported into the system, thus making the open data provided of higher quality compared to disclosing data in excel or CSV spreadsheet files, where there is normally no quality check of the dataset files to ensure that they are actually in a machine-readable format.\n\n*Translated from Thai*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\n-- About

The portal's uniqueness lies in the fact that it includes diverse information sources in one place, including: the municipality and its various units, municipal corporations, and the government. The primary goal of the site is to facilitate access to and use of data in order to enable a variety of users to derive value from public information. The portal is built as a data catalog that enables sophisticated search and optimal data consumption. The information is automatically updated from the municipality's internal databases for the benefit of the public and is made accessible in a variety of formats for the benefit of anyone interested in analyzing and processing data in Haifa. The portal provides hosting for tabular, spatial, and relational data with APIs and the ability to link data and services hosted by other governmental sources. Similar to the advanced open data portals in the world, it is built using CKAN open-source technology. Public organizations, the third sector, research institutes, academia, private companies, and the public are invited to use the data in accordance with the terms specified for each dataset on the portal. Improving the quantity and quality of data is an ongoing process, and we are constantly working to improve it. CKAN is a leading open-source platform worldwide for open data portals. CKAN offers a complete, ready-to-use solution that makes data accessible and enables convenient use of it, through tools that streamline data publication, sharing, searching, and use (including data storage and the provision of robust data APIs).

The site's primary goal is to encourage public access and reuse of public data. It was created out of a desire to make municipal and governmental information accessible on additional platforms, with the aim of making things as easy as possible for residents. This site provides a central catalog for discovering public data. It also provides hosting for tabular, spatial, and relational data with APIs and the ability to link data and services hosted by other governmental sources. Improving the quantity and quality of the data will be an ongoing process. In addition to open datasets, the site includes data that has not yet been published and data available for download and public use. The datasets provided here were created by the municipality and additional government bodies. As a result, we cannot guarantee the quality or timeliness of all the data. You can write brief feedback in the section called \"Contact Us,\" but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to fix all the problems identified with the datasets. However, we are in the process of adding a quality framework to make it easier for users to identify high-quality data that they can rely on.

The aim of this newly established web service is to offer scholarly journals an easy to handle infrastructure for managing and storing data sets of published articles and to link the data sets to their corresponding publication. The service is free of charge for academic journals. Working with the tool is easy and time-saving for editorial offices: The management of replication files is clearly facilitated for editorial offices. You do not have to care about maintaining a server for the replication data of published articles. Instead, you are free to focus on your core tasks and leave the whole technical part to the information specialists of ZBW. Articles with corresponding replication files reflect the high standard of your journal. Studies in other subjects even show that articles with replication files are cited more often than articles without replication files. The visibility of your journal and of the published articles with corresponding replication data increases. By using the ZBW Journal Data Archive and by employing a data availability policy, your journal shows that it reflects the current debates in science politics.

The National Open Data Portal provides a platform for those interested in public data and for individuals and organizations initiating the further use of data within the scope of the national data asset. NAV\u00dc Kft.'s goal is that, through the continuously developing National Open Data Portal, Hungary's international perception of its IT development will improve, and that the Hungarian public administration will achieve the best possible results based on the European Union's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) assessment criteria for open access data. Since 2014, the European Commission has published its report annually, including specific country reports that help Member States identify key areas for action. It also publishes thematic chapters that provide EU-level analysis of key digital policy areas. The 2022 DESI report on Hungary is available by clicking here. The Open Data Maturity Report (ODMR) aims to serve as a benchmark and provide insight into the progress made in the field of open access data in Europe. The report assesses the maturity level of each country along four dimensions - policy, portal, impact and quality. Within these, it establishes indicators for each country according to 16 criteria. Based on the report, countries can be classified into four different groups: trendsetters, accelerators, followers and beginners. The report formulates recommendations tailored to the maturity level and characteristics of each group. The 2024 ODMR report on Hungary is available by clicking here.

We believe that transparency builds trust and promotes information-based innovation. As part of this policy, we are pleased to make available to the general public an open data portal, which includes diverse databases about the city of Netanya and the municipality's activities. Currently, the site includes diverse databases from areas of the resident's life: transportation, education, housing, infrastructure, security, welfare, environment, business, etc., which are received from the municipality, government ministries, various corporations, and more. We believe that this project will bring many benefits to the advancement of the municipality and the city by achieving three central goals: 1. Increasing trust and partnership between the city's residents and the municipality. 2. Encouraging cooperation between the municipality and private entrepreneurs and promoting independent digital initiatives. 3. Streamlining the processes of receiving information from the municipality in specific requests for information. Open Source In the portal you can find municipal databases in open source format, using leading technology (CKAN infrastructure in open source). CKAN is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible to everyone by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, searching, and usage in order to enable the widest possible use of information. Types of Database Formats: The information in the portal is made accessible in various formats as detailed below: 1. XLS \u2013 A format based on an electronic data sheet that allows performing mathematical operations. 2. AutoCAD Formats \u2013 AutoCAD is a professional software for 2D and 3D design and drawing, used to create models of parts and other drawings for use in the manufacturing industry. The software generates several data formats that can be made accessible, including: Shx, SHP. 3. XML \u2013 is a markup language for documents containing structured information. XML is platform-independent and allows any computer program to use it, regardless of the type of hardware or operating system; the data can be processed. 4. Formats from GIS systems \u2013 including files of the type: cpj, Geo XML, GeoJSON. 5. JSON - an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation) is a textual format, readable to humans, designed for transferring information structures composed of key-value pairs. The main use of the format is to transfer information between a server and a consumer as a replacement for the XML format. 6. CSV - is a way to save tables in plain text.

Since 2012, we have shared data with Ontarians via a data catalogue. Open data is data that is shared with the public. Click here to learn more about open data and why Ontario releases it. Ontario\u2019s Open Data Directive states that all data must be open, unless there is good reason for it to remain confidential. Ontario\u2019s Chief Digital and Data Officer also has the authority to make certain datasets available publicly. Datasets listed in the catalogue that are not open will have one of the following labels: If you want to use data you find in the catalogue, that data must have a licence \u2013 a set of rules that describes how you can use it. A licence: Most of the data available in the catalogue is released under Ontario\u2019s Open Government Licence. However, each dataset may be shared with the public under other kinds of licences or no licence at all. If a dataset doesn\u2019t have a licence, you don\u2019t have the right to use the data. If you have questions about how you can use a specific dataset, please contact us. The Ontario Data Catalogue endeavors to publish open data in a machine readable format. For machine readable datasets, you can simply retrieve the file you need using the file URL. The Ontario Data Catalogue is built on CKAN, which means the catalogue has the following features you can use when building applications. APIs (Application programming interfaces) let software applications communicate directly with each other. If you are using the catalogue in a software application, you might want to extract data from the catalogue through the catalogue API. Note: All Datastore API requests to the Ontario Data Catalogue must be made server-side. The catalogue's collection of dataset metadata (and dataset files) is searchable through the CKAN API. The Ontario Data Catalogue has more than just CKAN's documented search fields. You can also search these custom fields. You can also use the CKAN API to retrieve metadata about a particular dataset and check for updated files. Read the complete documentation for CKAN's API. Some of the open data in the Ontario Data Catalogue is available through the Datastore API. You can also search and access the machine-readable open data that is available in the catalogue. How to use the API feature: Read the complete documentation for CKAN's Datastore API. The Ontario Data Catalogue contains a record for each dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses. Some of these datasets will be available to you as open data. Others will not be available to you. This is because the Government of Ontario is unable to share data that would break the law or put someone's safety at risk. You can search for a dataset with a word that might describe a dataset or topic. Use words like \u201ctaxes\u201d or \u201chospital locations\u201d to discover what datasets the catalogue contains. You can search for a dataset from 3 spots on the catalogue: the homepage, the dataset search page, or the menu bar available across the catalogue. On the dataset search page, you can also filter your search results. You can select filters on the left hand side of the page to limit your search for datasets with your favourite file format, datasets that are updated weekly, datasets released by a particular organization, or datasets that are released under a specific licence. Go to the dataset search page to see the filters that are available to make your search easier. You can also do a quick search by selecting one of the catalogue\u2019s categories on the homepage. These categories can help you see the types of data we have on key topic areas. When you find the dataset you are looking for, click on it to go to the dataset record. Each dataset record will tell you whether the data is available, and, if so, tell you about the data available. An open dataset might contain several data files. These files might represent different periods of time, different sub-sets of the dataset, different regions, language translations, or other breakdowns. You can select a file and either download it or preview it. Make sure to read the licence agreement to make sure you have permission to use it the way you want. Read more about previewing data. A non-open dataset may be not available for many reasons. Read more about non-open data. Read more about restricted data. Data that is non-open may still be subject to freedom of information requests. The catalogue has tools that enable all users to visualize the data in the catalogue without leaving the catalogue \u2013 no additional software needed. Have a look at our walk-through of how to make a chart in the catalogue. Get automatic notifications when datasets are updated. You can choose to get notifications for individual datasets, an organization\u2019s datasets or the full catalogue. You don\u2019t have to provide and personal information \u2013 just subscribe to our feeds using any feed reader you like using the corresponding notification web addresses. Copy those addresses and paste them into your reader. Your feed reader will let you know when the catalogue has been updated. The catalogue provides open data in several file formats (e.g., spreadsheets, geospatial data, etc). Learn about each format and how you can access and use the data each file contains. A file that has a list of items and values separated by commas without formatting (e.g. colours, italics, etc.) or extra visual features. This format provides just the data that you would display in a table. XLSX (Excel) files may be converted to CSV so they can be opened in a text editor. How to access the data: Open with any spreadsheet software application (e.g., Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel) or text editor. Note: This format is considered machine-readable, it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Files that have visual formatting (e.g. bolded headers and colour-coded rows) can be hard for machines to understand, these elements make a file more human-readable and less machine-readable. A file that provides information without formatted text or extra visual features that may not follow a pattern of separated values like a CSV. How to access the data: Open with any word processor or text editor available on your device (e.g., Microsoft Word, Notepad). A spreadsheet file that may also include charts, graphs, and formatting. How to access the data: Open with a spreadsheet software application that supports this format (e.g., Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel). Data can be converted to a CSV for a non-proprietary format of the same data without formatted text or extra visual features. A shapefile provides geographic information that can be used to create a map or perform geospatial analysis based on location, points/lines and other data about the shape and features of the area. It includes required files (.shp, .shx, .dbt) and might include corresponding files (e.g., .prj). How to access the data: Open with a geographic information system (GIS) software program (e.g., QGIS). A package of files and folders. The package can contain any number of different file types. How to access the data: Open with an unzipping software application (e.g., WinZIP, 7Zip). Note: If a ZIP file contains .shp, .shx, and .dbt file types, it is an ArcGIS ZIP: a package of shapefiles which provide information to create maps or perform geospatial analysis that can be opened with ArcGIS (a geographic information system software program). A file that provides information related to a geographic area (e.g., phone number, address, average rainfall, number of owl sightings in 2011 etc.) and its geospatial location (i.e., points/lines). How to access the data: Open using a GIS software application to create a map or do geospatial analysis. It can also be opened with a text editor to view raw information. Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A text-based format for sharing data in a machine-readable way that can store data with more unconventional structures such as complex lists. How to access the data: Open with any text editor (e.g., Notepad) or access through a browser. Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A text-based format to store and organize data in a machine-readable way that can store data with more unconventional structures (not just data organized in tables). How to access the data: Open with any text editor (e.g., Notepad). Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A file that provides information related to an area (e.g., phone number, address, average rainfall, number of owl sightings in 2011 etc.) and its geospatial location (i.e., points/lines). How to access the data: Open with a geospatial software application that supports the KML format (e.g., Google Earth). Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. This format contains files with data from tables used for statistical analysis and data visualization of Statistics Canada census data. How to access the data: Open with the Beyond 20/20 application. A database which links and combines data from different files or applications (including HTML, XML, Excel, etc.). The database file can be converted to a CSV/TXT to make the data machine-readable, but human-readable formatting will be lost. How to access the data: Open with Microsoft Office Access (a database management system used to develop application software). A file that keeps the original layout and formatting of a page. The contents of a PDF cannot be edited directly. How to access the data: Open with web browsers, PDF readers, and word processors. A text file which can include images, tables and many other formatting options. How to access the data: Open with doc/docx compatible word processors. A text file which can include basic text formatting and images. How to access the data: Opens with most word processors (e.g., OpenOffice). Open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will vary in how it is organized and formatted. Depending on the licence agreement for a dataset, you can choose to organize and format the file to suit your intended use. Some of the open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will have a data dictionary. A data dictionary can help you understand what the dataset means. If you need further understanding the data, reach out to the dataset point of contact.

E-government promotes the efficiency of the \"administrative machine\" through: the digitization of back and front office processes and online services; the dissemination of a greater digital culture and the fight against the digital divide; the sharing of skills, resources, and visions within the community in a logic of sharing. The data held by Public Administrations represents an enormous asset and is acquiring ever-increasing importance. The establishment of OPEN DATA, in accordance with the Growth Decree 2.0 (DL 179/2012 converted with L. 221/2012), stems from the obligation for Public Administrations to make data not only public but also freely usable, implementable, and redistributable. The use of open data is an indispensable condition both for the conscious exercise of citizenship and for greater efficiency of public government functions: data, in fact, represent not only quantitative but also qualitative entities, capable of producing value if they trigger innovation processes. The output connected to the adoption of open data is twofold. On the one hand, for the Public Administration, this modality implies the improvement of transparency and the efficiency of the administrative machine; on the other hand, for the community, the possibility of actively and consciously participating in the construction of policies for a shared development of its territory, overcoming NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) logics. The effort related to the use of open data for the Public Administration is connected to the need to systematize a plurality of often sectoral and outdated data, according to criteria of ease of access, explanatory clarity, agility in reprocessing and sharing, possibility of integration and \"cross-sectional reading\": in this regard, the establishment of an interoperable digital \"platform\" (portal or dataset) capable of providing updated and implementable information in real time is essential; furthermore, it is fundamental that the data, in addition to being continuously updated and interoperable, are also \"cross-referenced\" in order to allow re-interpretive readings that can best support the strategic directions and policies inherent in the government of the territory. For the community, the effort \u2013 and the stimulus \u2013 consists in acquiring new skills and consequently a more proactive role in the public debate, overcoming the digital divide and feeling \"at ease\" in the universe of bits. In essence, OPEN DATA is an indispensable tool for: generating more efficient modes of government developing more pervasive and collaborative networks within a process of territorial governance, shared with social and economic operators and with citizens in a common idea of intelligent, sustainable and inclusive development of the territory (see Europe 2020 Strategy). However, in addition to the construction of adequate information and networking tools (digital platform), a capacity for critical, cross-sectional and multidisciplinary reading of the data is also necessary, so that quantitative information is not the end but the means to address in an integrated way the environmental, social and economic problems of the territory and consequently delineate the most appropriate policies.

L\u2019utilizzo di open data \u00e8 una condizione indispensabile sia per l\u2019esercizio consapevole della cittadinanza sia per una maggiore efficienza delle funzioni di governo pubblico: i dati rappresentano infatti non solo entit\u00e0 quantitative ma anche qualitative, in grado di produrre valore se innescano processi di innovazione.

Subsequently, the Cabinet resolution on December 3, 2019, approved the government agencies to import statistical data, situations, or any other data into the eMENSCR system for monitoring, inspection, and evaluation of the implementation of the national strategy and the national reform plan, to drive the implementation towards the same goal in a concrete manner. The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) has therefore established a government open data portal to support the monitoring and evaluation of operations under the national strategy (Open Data Portal for Monitoring and Evaluating Government Projects under National Strategy) to link information datasets between government agencies. It allows the import of statistical data, situations, or other data from eMENSCR, especially those consistent with the national strategy and the master plan under the national strategy, to facilitate service users from the public sector, the private business sector, and government agencies to benefit from government open data. This allows them to search and access quality, up-to-date, secure, and safe data, as well as provides a channel for monitoring government operations and the implementation under the national

The general public must be able to access it freely without charge and can disseminate, utilize, or develop services and innovations in various forms, including demonstrating transparency in operations and making them auditable by all sectors.\n\nAccording to the Royal Gazette, the announcement of the Digital Government Development Committee was published on 24 June 2020 on standards and criteria for disclosing open government data in digital form to the public for the benefit of facilitating people to access data and setting guidelines and standards for government agencies to deliver or link such data to the public at the Open Government Data of Thailand Center at the website data.go.th.\n\nOpen government data is \u201cdata that government agencies must disclose to the public under the Government Information Act in a digital format that can be accessed and used freely, without platform restrictions, without cost, published, reproduced or utilized for any purpose.\u201d In short, it is government data that has gone through a data secrecy process and is considered \u201cpublic data.\u201d Users can use, analyze or modify this data as needed.\n\nAn inventory is a document that lists all the data sets, grouped or classified, in the possession or control of a government agency.\n\nData descriptions that comply with the standards set by the NESDB are the mandatory metadata descriptions for government data sets, which are 14 mandatory data descriptions for each data set that government agencies must prepare and provide details about.\n\nData accounting system is a system that manages the data accounting of an organization, such as CKAN or others.\n\nPublic information is information that can be disclosed and used freely, whether it is news information, personal information, or electronic information.\n\nOpen features are features of a file that are not restricted by any conditions from the product owner. They are freely accessible without any cost to use or process in a variety of software.\n\nThe National Research Office (NRCT) is an agency with duties and powers related to research and innovation funding, creating a database and index of national science, research, and innovation, initiating, driving, and coordinating the implementation of important research and innovation projects of the country, establishing research standards and ethics, promoting and transferring knowledge for use, promoting and supporting the development of research and innovation personnel, and granting awards, certificates of honor, or praising individuals or agencies related to research and innovation. All operational data of the National Research Office (NRCT) is therefore an important part used to support various research and innovation activities, including national development, such as using it to support the implementation of digital economic and social policies for all sectors to use data to develop services or further develop innovations, etc. Therefore, the disclosure of government data by the National Research Office (NRCT) is important for the use of research and innovation data for national development. Therefore, it has a policy to implement a data governance framework and develop a data catalog system to lead to the disclosure of government data (Open Data).\n\n\n\n*Translated from

The fundamental premise of the global \"Open Data\" movement is based on the value generated from the reuse of public data for various purposes. The great added value resulting from open data, whether in terms of greater transparency of municipal activity or of general value for Academia and for citizens and companies, has, therefore, mobilized the public sector globally to develop strategies in this direction. In this context, the Municipality of Porto believes that in order to implement an impactful strategy that promotes the sustainable development of an open data platform, it is necessary to adopt a holistic and cross-cutting vision for the entire city. Based on this premise, the Municipality defined a Strategic Plan for Valorizing the data of the Municipality of Porto, which aims to ensure a true paradigm shift at the municipal level in the way data is managed and processed in its context. Current Open Data Paradigm The increasing informational demands that are felt, resulting from the advent of information technologies, have a strong impact on cities, not only due to the ever-increasing volume of data produced and available that needs to be managed and leveraged to improve municipal management, but also due to the continuous evolution of data analysis, exploration, and processing technologies. The exercise is not only about modernizing the technological structure, adapting it to the systems and mechanisms that are constantly updated, but, above all, seeking the continuous improvement of services provided to citizens, companies, and institutions. The availability and reuse of public sector data for private purposes or by Research & Development institutions can be an important contribution to the development of new services based on innovative ways of combining and using this data, stimulating economic growth, the production of scientific knowledge, and promoting social intervention. Vision of the Municipality of Porto regarding the current Open Data paradigm Among the values that guide the activity and culture of the Municipality of Porto, the following stand out: citizen orientation, continuous improvement, and innovation. In this context, and bearing in mind the growing importance assumed by data, information, and the knowledge that can be generated from it, the Municipality of Porto intends to respond to the challenge of the current open data paradigm. Open Data Portal of the Municipality of Porto With the aim of generating value through the provision of information that can be used and combined in order to generate knowledge by the most diverse agents of the city, the Municipality of Porto will implement an Open Data Portal. Therefore, the intention is that the Portal will be not only a data repository, but also a collaborative interface and active participation between the Municipality, citizens, companies, Academia, institutions, and other organizations and entities from the most diverse areas of intervention, in a more transparent and participatory governance strategy on the part of the city. This data, much of it georeferenced, is extremely useful, constituting a support for municipal activity, a tool to support decision-making, the delineation of well-informed and supported policies and strategies, in line with the objective of creating smart, inclusive, and sustainable cities, as enshrined in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Scope and objectives of this strategic document This document aims to systematize the guiding principles upstream of the creation of the Open Data Portal of the Municipality of Porto, contextualizing them in the current paradigm of providing data to citizens, Academia, companies, and other entities as a way to enhance governmental transparency and improve the participation of agents in the process of constructing knowledge about the city. 1) The open data policy Information is a necessity for any sector of human activity. Data/information is one of the main assets of organizations, regardless of their scope of activity. The transformation of information into knowledge is currently considered a factor of primary importance for the competitiveness of companies, institutions, and territories. The European Union, namely within the scope of the Digital Agenda for Europe, has been encouraging Member States to adopt open data initiatives. The reasons have to do with the fact that: 2) Vision and strategy of the Municipality of Porto regarding open data As a contribution to the implementation of European and national strategies in terms of public transparency, the process of providing open data to the city's agents by the Municipality of Porto has the following fundamental objectives: In this context, the Vision of the Municipality of Porto in this regard consists of maximizing the opportunities that arise from the availability and use of data and information from the Municipality, thus contributing to increasing and promoting the competitiveness of the city of Porto and the region transversally, for visiting, residing, studying, attracting, and doing business in the national and international market. 3) The Open Data Portal of the Municipality of Porto This Portal is based on the principles of open data and is made available by the Municipality of Porto with the aim of generating value for society. Open data reflects greater transparency of the Municipality, more active participation of the citizen, and potentiates the development of better and new private products and services. This Portal will be a driver of innovation, the improvement of municipal services, and the creation of knowledge with the combination of different data, assuming a role of great interest for the city. The Open Data Portal was developed by the Municipality of Porto, using the open source CKAN platform. Target Audience The open data of the city of Porto is intended for citizens (residents), entrepreneurs, tourists, researchers, students, and the community of programmers who intend to use them in the implementation of applications. What exists on the Portal? The Portal provides a catalog of metadata that aims to allow access to data from the Municipality of Porto or data shared by third parties, these being available in formats both for traditional human reading and for machines. The Portal also has a space for disseminating a selection of applications developed based on the data made available on it. How to participate in the Portal One of the objectives of the Portal is to encourage the participation of citizens, Academia and companies through the presentation of suggestions regarding publication, correction of detected errors, sharing of their own data and dissemination of the uses they make of the data. For this purpose, please contact: dados@cm-porto.pt Access to the data can be made by any anonymous User without the need to register on the Portal.\n\n*Translated from Portuguese*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o Plano de Gest\u00e3o e Valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados do Munic\u00edpio do Porto A premissa fundamental do movimento global \"Dados Abertos\" assenta no valor gerado a partir da reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados p\u00fablicos para v\u00e1rios fins. O grande valor acrescentado decorrente dos dados abertos, seja no \u00e2mbito de maior transpar\u00eancia da atividade municipal ou de geral valor para a Academia e para os cidad\u00e3os e empresas, tem, portanto, mobilizado o setor p\u00fablico a n\u00edvel global a desenvolver estrat\u00e9gias neste sentido. Neste contexto, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto acredita que para implementar uma estrat\u00e9gia de impacto, que promova o desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel de uma plataforma de dados abertos, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio adotar uma vis\u00e3o hol\u00edstica e transversal a toda a cidade. Assente nessa premissa, o Munic\u00edpio definiu um Plano Estrat\u00e9gico de Valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados do Muncipio do Porto. que visa garantir uma verdadeira altera\u00e7\u00e3o de paradigma a n\u00edvel municipal na forma como os dados s\u00e3o geridos e processados no seu contexto. Atual paradigma do Open Data As crescentes exig\u00eancias informacionais que se fazem sentir, fruto do advento das tecnologias de informa\u00e7\u00e3o, t\u00eam um forte impacto nas cidades, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pelo volume cada vez maior de dados produzidos e dispon\u00edveis que precisam de ser geridos e potencializados para melhorar a gest\u00e3o municipal, como pela cont\u00ednua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das tecnologias de an\u00e1lise, explora\u00e7\u00e3o e processamento de dados. O exerc\u00edcio que se coloca n\u00e3o diz respeito apenas \u00e0 moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura tecnol\u00f3gica, adequando-a aos sistemas e mecanismos que se encontram em constante atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o, mas, e sobretudo, procurar a melhoria cont\u00ednua dos servi\u00e7os prestados aos cidad\u00e3os, empresas e institui\u00e7\u00f5es. A disponibilidade e reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados do setor p\u00fablico para fins privados ou por parte das institui\u00e7\u00f5es de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o & Desenvolvimento pode constituir um importante contributo para o desenvolvimento de novos servi\u00e7os baseados em modos inovadores de combinar e utilizar esses mesmos dados, estimulando o crescimento econ\u00f3mico, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimento cient\u00edfico e promovendo a interven\u00e7\u00e3o social.

Neste \u00e2mbito, e tendo muito presente a crescente import\u00e2ncia assumida pelos dados, da informa\u00e7\u00e3o e do conhecimento que a partir deles pode ser gerado, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto pretende responder ao desafio do atual paradigma de dados abertos. Portal de Dados Abertos do Munic\u00edpio do Porto Com o intuito de gerar valor atrav\u00e9s da disponibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o que pode ser utilizada e combinada de forma a gerar conhecimento pelos mais diversificados agentes da cidade, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto vai implementar um Portal de Dados Abertos. Assim sendo, pretende-se que o Portal seja n\u00e3o s\u00f3 um reposit\u00f3rio de dados, mas igualmente um interface colaborativo e de participa\u00e7\u00e3o ativa entre o Munic\u00edpio, os cidad\u00e3os, as empresas, a Academia, as institui\u00e7\u00f5es e demais organiza\u00e7\u00f5es e entidades das mais diversas \u00e1reas de interven\u00e7\u00e3o, numa estrat\u00e9gia de governa\u00e7\u00e3o mais transparente e participativa, por parte da cidade. Estes dados, muitos deles georreferenciados, s\u00e3o extremamente \u00fateis, constituindo um suporte \u00e0 atividade municipal, uma ferramenta de apoio \u00e0 tomada de decis\u00e3o, \u00e0 delinea\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas e estrat\u00e9gias bem informadas e suportadas, em conson\u00e2ncia com o objetivo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de cidades inteligentes, inclusivas e sustent\u00e1veis, plasmado na Estrat\u00e9gia Europa 2020. \u00c2mbito e objetivos deste documento estrat\u00e9gico Com este documento pretende-se sistematizar os princ\u00edpios orientadores a montante da cria\u00e7\u00e3o do Portal de Dados Abertos do Munic\u00edpio do Porto, contextualizando-os no atual paradigma de disponibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados aos cidad\u00e3os, \u00e0 Academia, empresas e demais entidades como forma de potenciar a transpar\u00eancia governativa e melhorar a participa\u00e7\u00e3o dos agentes no processo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimento sobre a cidade. 1) A pol\u00edtica de dados abertos A informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma necessidade para qualquer setor da atividade humana.

After the existence of the One Data Information System (SISTA) of Solok Selatan Regency, the government or data users who need data can obtain data directly by accessing the website of the One Data Information System (SISTA) of Solok Selatan Regency. At the beginning of the implementation, this innovation was named the One Data Information System (SISTA) of Solok Selatan Regency. Over time, this innovation has undergone system development/renewal, so that currently the SISTA innovation has changed its name to \"OPEN DATA of Solok Selatan Regency,\" which has been integrated with the One Data Portal of West Sumatra and the One Data Portal of Indonesia.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Access to information can be done without having to go to the OPD (Data Producer) or the Central Statistics Agency of Solok Selatan Regency.\n2. Public Information Applicants can make information requests at any time by accessing the website of the One Data Information System (SISTA) of Solok Selatan Regency.\n\n*Translated from Indonesian*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nSISTEM INFORMASI SATU DATA (SISTA) KABUPATEN SOLOK SELATAN Dasar Hukum 1.

central location for all Transport for NSW open data. The Open Data Hub was established in April 2016 at the Future Transport summit and replaced the Transport Data Exchange (TDX) Program. Since the launch of the Hub we have welcomed more than 35,700+ registered users who have created 9000+ applications via the Open Data Hub. Browse our data catalogue to explore our available APIs, downloadable datasets, interactive maps and insights. The Open Data Hub now hosts over 200 datasets with over 1000 resources (APIs, files and other documents) and counting. Use topics, tags and formats to narrow down to your interest area. If you are interested in geospatial in particular, check out our datasets with geospatial resources. The maps are interactive allowing you to search, filter, zoom in/out. Maps data is downloadable as geospatial files resources within the same dataset. For visualisations and insights on transport related matters, you can go directly by selecting Browse Insights. Transport Open Data is sourced by many developers to feed reference or real time data into their apps which service millions of NSW citizens. To support developers getting started on using Transport Open Data, we have compiled under Developers section a collection of useful resources including step-by-step user guide, documentation, and developer information. Transport Open Data team works and collaborates continuously with various Transport teams and partners to enhance and enrich its platform, its features, data & insights available. See our Data Stories to find out some examples of how we are leveraging Transport data to provide passengers and communities with up to date and real time information Each year we run multiple Innovation Challenges, aimed at encouraging finding new ways of using data, innovation in the NSW transport sector and improving the customer experience across all transport modes in NSW. Head over to our Innovation Challenges page to view current and past challenges. Data collaborations and partnerships play an important role in enabling improvements or new ways of using Transport data, with significant positive outcomes for Transport passengers and NSW communities, in line with Transport strategies. Through co-design, co-create or data exchange with other government, research, education or industry organisations we leverage partners\u2019 expertise and resources, enable whole of government outcomes, improve transport outcomes across the sector, all for the benefit of people of NSW. The Open Data Forum is the place to go to seek advice from our community of developers and TfNSW staff who are on hand to help.

It aims to create an active interdisciplinary community that studies, documents, learns, disseminates, and implements participatory planning processes for public space. It places particular emphasis on supporting green infrastructure design projects and actions, and ecosystem-based approaches in urban areas, with the aim of increasing their resilience to climate change. The Laboratory of Spatial, Urban and Environmental Participatory Planning for Climate Change Adaptation consists of scientists and professionals who deal with the different, multiple aspects of the subject. Its vision is to create and support a significant community of people in critical positions who place adaptation to climate change and participatory planning at the heart of planning. The participatory LAB belongs to a broader initiative by COMMONSPACE that aims to create participatory design methodologies and support tools that support plans, projects, and actions for adaptation to climate change. Participatory planning, after all, is based on the logic of \"bottom-up\" governance and also on the democratic right of those who influence and are influenced by a decision to participate in the design and decision-making processes from the outset. The actions to be carried out concern the formation of the community, the education of the community, and finally, pilot applications of Participatory Planning for Adaptation to Climate Change. Both the formation of the community and the selection of pilot applications will be done with an open invitation and co-design procedures. The participatory LAB will be able to support: - Municipalities and Regions - Resilience and Climate Change Offices - Individual spatial designers, landscape architects, urban green and green/blue infrastructure designers - Researchers and scholars of the impacts of climate change - Students - Researchers - Civil Society Organizations and city movements The project \"participatory LAB\" is funded by the Green Fund under Priority Axis 3: Citizen Participation \"Innovative actions with citizens\" of the funding program \"Natural Environment & Innovative Actions 2020\".\n\n*Translated from

to the monitoring data collected or generated by NFWF grantees and partners through our programs that fund conservation for coastal resilience, including the Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program. This searchable data platform is designed to store metadata and data files for discovery and sharing among NFWF grantees, partners and the wider conservation community. Datasets include both spatial and tabular data and span ecological and socioeconomic topics for coastal restoration activities at locations funded by each program. A list of the NFWF programs currently participating in this platform is available on the Programs page. This data platform is part of a broader effort to provide a transparent means of reporting the measurable impacts of coastal resilience projects.

West Virginia Checkbook operates in accordance with three principles: transparency, clarity, and integrity. We strive to provide as much public financial information as possible to the taxpayer to allow them to make informed decisions and empower them to oversee how public elected officials utilize their tax dollars. We strive to make our public-facing reports and sites easy to use and understand, eliminating the need for advanced knowledge in accounting or government operations to understand the bottom line. We provide all of our financial information without bias or spin -- just giving taxpayers the facts and numbers. If you can't find the answer you're looking for (or for more complex research requests) West Virginia Checkbook can research the information for you. Please fill out this form for assistance. We can provide you an answer within one to five business days, depending upon your request. Please note certain State or local government agencies are not required by law to furnish or report certain data to West Virginia Checkbook. We may have to refer your request to a specific state or local government agency to fulfill your request. We stand by ready to help 9 AM - 5 PM EST, excluding weekends and public holidays. This tool permits you to select specific State financial transactions and ask questions about those payments directly through the portal. Please see the User's Guide for more information. You can contact us at (304)-558-2251 or toll-free at (877)-982-9148. Unless exempted by State or Federal law, the majority of the financial information found on West Virginia Checkbook comes directly from the same accounting databases used by the State and local governments to record financial transactions. This allows constituents to gain a real-time view into the books. Some of the reports and calculators on West Virginia Checkbook are special tools and reports that utilize other sources of data outside these databases to provide financial information. In some instances, we provide reports prepared by other agencies using different sources of financial information, such as the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. We provide links to these reports as a convenience to users so they are no longer forced to visit multiple websites to access State financial data. There are a limited number of State agencies who are permitted by law to conduct their accounting operations outside of the State accounting databases.

Developed add-ons are available at: https://github.com/dpp-dev The Latvian Open Data Portal was created by the European Regional Development Fund co-financed project Nr. 2.2.1.1/16/I/001 \"Public Administration Information and Communication Technology Architecture Management System\" (PIKTAPS) The Third Action Plan for Open Government Partnership of Latvia is taking an action towards openness, responsibility, publics\u2019 participation and the use of ICT [1] This plan carries out the improvement and implementation of various services in the Internet environment. One of the 12 commitment plans of Latvia is the development of an open-source public data portal. But to fulfill the entire target of 2017-2019 OGP plan Latvia has committed to involve society in the selection of datasets. Consequently, the website has the ability to vote which data should be opened. So far in Latvia many valuable data were not available, since collecting them is a paid service, for that reason, access to re-usable data containing metadata has been difficult. Only a few institutions, on their own initiative, published open data on their websites. In 2013, the European Union (EU) adopted the Directive 2013/37/EU with a view to introducing uniform practices and rules in all Member States for the re-use of public administration information. In Latvia, in 2015, the relevant amendments were incorporated into the Information Disclosure Law. According to the directive, in Latvia the data that is open should be published \"on the authority of its own initiative, if it is useful \", which means the voluntary principle in the publication of data and does not promote the general\" open by default \"compliance with the principle. This portal was opened within the OGP to facilitate the opening of data, of course, with respect to the protection of personal data. Involving society in choosing the datasets to be opened. From this commitment, an open data portal, gains all the groups of the public: Members of the society will not only be able to vote for data sets of interest to them, but also to obtain data without bureaucracy. Government institutions will increase the efficiency of work and improve their image by opening and publishing their data. Entrepreneurs will have more data available that can be used to create new products or services, thus contributing to overall economic growth.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [100.4935089, 13.7524938]}, "properties": {"id": "f510e50e-4992-4cc6-bb0f-6e6876efafb8", "name": "health-promotion-foundation", "title": "Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth)", "url": "https://data.thaihealth.or.th", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/health-promotion-foundation", "state": "active", "description": "The Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth)\n\n*Translated from Thai*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\n\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e38\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e (\u0e2a\u0e2a\u0e2a.)", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [14.843984, 40.860672]}, "properties": {"id": "2cb08b22-ba22-4c89-8fbc-9b928915babf", "name": "arpac-campania-open-data", "title": "ARPAC Campania Open Data", "url": "https://dati.arpacampania.it", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/arpac-campania-open-data", "state": "active", "description": "ARPAC Open Data is the portal where data produced by the activities of ARPA Campania are contributed.

The major tasks, which CBS has been performing, are decennial population census, agriculture census and quinquennial manufacturing establishment census. In addition, many household surveys like living standard surveys, labor force surveys and multiple indicator surveillance are indispensable tasks, which CBS has been accomplishing. The role of the CBS is always decisive for the effective functioning of the national statistical system as a whole. It promotes collaborative research efforts among members of academic community, data producers and users. It has a prominent role in developing statistical system and maintaining statistical standard in the country. Statistics Act, 2079 came into effect on August, 2022. As the provision of the act, CBS has upgraded to the National Statistics Office (NSO). The National Statistics Office (NSO) is the central statistical organization of the country responsible for the production and dissemination of official statistics.

A large amount of this data is collected during the course of normal government activities, including the provision of services, research, or administration. Open data, by definition, must be freely available, easily discoverable, anonymous, accessible, automatically published, and licensed to allow its reuse. By publishing this information in a central location, at datos.congresogto.gob.mx, it is now easy to find, explore, and reuse. Examples of how open data is used include creating an application, researching, supporting evidence-based decision-making, developing a business plan to create goods or services, or simply improving knowledge and understanding of social, economic, and environmental trends. Government open data does not contain private or confidential information, as the data is anonymized before publication. This is done to ensure that the highest standards of privacy are met and security is not compromised. The volume of data from the Legislative Branch of the State of Guanajuato is currently growing at an increasing rate; so is the potential value of this data. Making data open has economic and social benefits. Some of the valuable datasets include transportation data, cartographic (geospatial) data, health data, environmental data, demographic data, and real-time emergency data. Most of the time, the agency publishing the data cannot foresee its future use, or how it might be combined with other data or displayed in a program, interface, or tool. Open data creates connections between the government, the private and research sectors, stimulating entrepreneurial activity and developing knowledge that can benefit all Mexicans. When government data is put online, it also makes things more efficient. Agencies can store, share, and update data across the normal boundaries of departments or areas. Having a single source of truth reduces the time and costs of doing regular government business. There are even more uses: open data helps in the development of evidence-based decisions that lead to better informed policies, research, and social outcomes. The policy of the Legislative Branch of the State of Guanajuato on public data is simple: all agencies and institutional areas must make non-confidential data open by default, and it must be free, easy to use, and reliable.

CBGA is an independent, not-for-profit policy research organisation working towards enhancing transparency and accountability and fostering people's participation in governance by demystifying government budgets. Increasingly, people across the country are keen to understand and participate meaningfully in discussions on government budgets. However, the gaps in availability of relevant and accessible information on budgets in India at different levels have created a hindrance in this regard. Accessibility to comprehensive, relevant and easy to use data on budgets becomes a challenge as we move from the level of the Union Government to the States and then further below to the local levels. The improvements over the last decade with regard to the availability and quality of fiscal data in the country have been uneven - across States and across different types of schemes. In this context, our endeavour is to strengthen the discourse and demand for availability of all budget information in the public domain in a timely and accessible manner, at all levels of government in the country. As part of the efforts in this sphere, we have developed the portal - Open Budgets India (OBI), which is meant to be a comprehensive and user-friendly open data portal that can facilitate free, easy and timely access to relevant data on government budgets in India. OBI is an on-going initiative, and its evolution so far can be divided broadly into two phases. In the first phase, which was over the years 2015 to 2019, OBI was conceptualised and developed through the collective efforts of many individuals and organisations led by the research team at CBGA. In this first phase of development of OBI, the support and technical inputs provided by organisations like Macromoney Research Initiatives Private Limited, DataKind Bangalore, Centre for Internet and Society, and DataMeet played an important role. The second phase of development of the OBI, which started in early 2020, has been steered by Public Finance researchers at CBGA and multidisciplinary team at CivicDataLab (CDL). CDL has been the lead technology partner of the OBI in this phase, with CBGA leading the research and development work relating to fiscal information and data. This second phase of OBI has focused on vertically deepening our efforts towards making relevant fiscal information available in public domain, not only at the level of the Union Government and the States, but also for districts and below. The central idea behind the second phase has been to present a range of analytics, in addition to the raw fiscal data and budget documents, which could be relevant for facilitating public engagement with fiscal governance issues. The analytics have been presented in the form of a number of new dashboards on OBI and are centred around data on flagship Central Schemes in the country as well as select State Schemes for a number of States. Additionally, we are also making concerted efforts to enable the non-technical users to comprehend the technicalities around government budgets in the country and the fiscal data and analytics. The new dashboards and resources integrated on OBI in this second phase include: Schemes Dashboard containing the fiscal data and relevant analytics for 30 Central Schemes and nearly 75 State Schemes from 20 States; Sectors Dashboard comprising fiscal data on more than 10 social and economic sectors for all States; District Dashboard comprising district-wise fiscal data for all districts in six selected States for 12 Central Schemes; State Budget Explorers for three States that present the State Budget data in machine-readable formats; Budget Basics microsite which provides easy to comprehend explanations of fundamental concepts, terminologies and processes relating to government budgets; Short Videos meant to facilitate better understanding of some of the important developments and strategies in budgeting in India; and A discussion forum on budgets named the Budget Forum, which is meant to be a hub for discussions on public finance related topics and serve as a platform for sharing of relevant resources on budgets by different users. Access to Constituency-wise data can enable the elected representatives to engage a lot more effectively with the processes of policy design, expenditure priority setting and monitoring of implementation. It can also strengthen public oversight and participation in governance. This is particularly relevant for strengthening public financial management in the socio-economic sectors, where there is a need for improving allocative efficiency, utilisation of public resources, quality of services delivered and the development outcomes. Against such a backdrop, CBGA, in collaboration with its technology partner CivicDataLab, has also carried out an in-depth analytical exercise to map fiscal data for a number of development schemes to the Assembly Constituencies (ACs) and Parliamentary Constituencies (PCs) in six selected States. The overarching objective of this initiative is to explore how fiscal information available to the citizens and their elected representatives can be made more relevant locally in order to strengthen their oversight and participation in public financial management. Guided by such a vision, the initiative has: Mapped the administrative boundaries (Gram Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies) to the boundaries of the ACs and PCs (covering all the ACs and PCs) in six States, viz, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh; Collected, organised and mapped disaggregated fiscal information on major development schemes into ACs and PCs in the selected States (covering MGNREGS, SBM-G, SBM-U, PMAY-G, NSAP, PMFBY, PM-KISAN, SmSA, MDM, NHM, ICDS and PMMVY) for three to four financial years; and Developed analytics and visualizations with the AC-wise and PC-wise fiscal data to facilitate its uptake by different actors in the governance landscape. The Constituency-wise mapping of fiscal information for selected schemes for the selected States has been presented on a dashboard -- the Constituency Dashboard -- on the OBI portal. This 'open data' dashboard provides: The methodology developed for mapping the administrative units of a State into Constituencies; Complete and up-to-date Geo-files for the six selected States (i.e. the files that have mapped the administrative units into ACs and PCs); The methodologies for mapping fiscal data on 12 schemes into ACs and PCs; and The Constituency-wise mapped fiscal data for 12 schemes for the six selected States for three to four financial years (2018-19 to 2021-22). This initiative, over the two phases of development, has received financial support and guidance of a number of institutions, which include: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Omidyar Network (ON) International Development Research Centre - Think Tank Initiative (IDRC-TTI) National Foundation for India (NFI) Last updated on 25th February 2023.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-6.2605593, 53.3493795]}, "properties": {"id": "f8a403d1-4a34-4366-bf25-444bc1214472", "name": "dafm-open-data", "title": "DAFM Open Data", "url": "https://opendata.agriculture.gov.ie", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/dafm-open-data", "state": "active", "description": "The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine publishes a wide range of information across all areas of the Department.

Instead, it\u2019s a grassroots initiative, maintained by Code for Africa, as a public service. The platform is available as a free resource for ordinary citizens, civil society organisations, civic activists, the media, and government agencies. You can upload your data to openAFRICA either to store it, or to make it available to a wider public. You can also download data already on openAFRICA for re-use in your own projects. We are happy to help you both upload and re-use data. Much of the data on openAFRICA has been liberated by pioneering organisations, volunteers or activists, and is an eclectic collection that is far from comprehensive. You will, however, find datasets here that are difficult to access elsewhere. If there is crucial data that you can't find here or elsewhere, get in touch and we might be able to help you extricate it. All the data on openAFRICA is intended to be actionable. The data is meant to help you change the world. We want you to analyse it, visualise it, share it, and build tools or services with it. openAFRICA is maintained by Code for Africa, with additional support from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the World Bank. Individual datasets or data collections on openAFRICA may receive support from additional partners. While openAFRICA runs as a free public service, it costs real money and time to maintain. Code for Africa is therefore always keen to hear from potential partners who are interested in helping support the initiative. Give us a shout here to chat about the possibilities.

When will India's population surpass that of China? Where can you admire publicly funded works of art in Seattle? The data to answer many, many questions like these exists somewhere on the Internet - but it's not always easy to find. The Open Data platform, created as part of the actions foreseen by the Tuscan Digital Agenda, makes reusable public data available in open format, thus maximizing transparency and ease of access to the many pieces of information available to the Tuscany Region. The goal is to publish, through a gradual process, the many datasets whose ownership belongs to the Tuscany Region and other Public Administrations of the regional territory adhering to the Tuscan Regional Telematics Network (RTRT), creating an infrastructure that will allow public and private entities and civil society to create new services and applications capable of improving access to information, transparency, and therefore the social, cultural, and economic life of the entire Tuscan territory. This site is based on a powerful open-source data cataloging software, called CKAN, developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation. Each 'dataset' entry on CKAN contains a description of the data and other useful information, such as the available formats, the holder, the freedom of access and reuse, and the topics that the data address. Other users can improve or modify this information (CKAN keeps a history of all these changes). CKAN is used for several data catalogs on the Internet. The Data Hub is a freely editable and reusable catalog, in the style of Wikipedia. The British government uses CKAN for the data.gov.uk portal, which currently has about 8000 government datasets. The official public data of most European countries are collected in a CKAN catalog on publicdata.eu. There is also a list of these catalogs from all over the world on datacatalogs.org, which is in turn based on CKAN. Most of the data on the Tuscany Region Open Data portal is freely accessible and reusable: anyone has the right to use and reuse the data in any way they prefer. Maybe someone will take that nice dataset on the city's works of art that you found, and add it to a tourist map - or develop a new app for your smartphone, which will help you find monuments when you visit the city. Open data means more enterprise, collaborative scientific research, and transparent public administration. You can learn more about this topic in the Open Data Handbook. The Open Knowledge Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes free knowledge: the development and constant improvement of CKAN is one of the ways to achieve this goal. If you want to participate in the design or development, join the public discussion or development lists, or check out the OKFN website to discover the other ongoing projects. CKAN is the world's leading platform for open-source data portals. CKAN is a complete and ready-to-use software solution that makes data accessible and usable \u2013 providing tools to optimize its publication, search and use (including data storage and the availability of robust APIs). CKAN is aimed at organizations that publish data (national and local governments, companies and institutions) and want to make it open and accessible to all. CKAN is used by governments and user groups around the world to manage a wide range of data portals for official and community bodies, including portals for local, national and international governments, such as data.gov.uk in the UK and publicdata.eu of the European Union, dados.gov.br in Brazil, government portals of the Netherlands and the Netherlands, as well as city and municipal administration sites in the USA, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Finland and other countries.

Quando avverr\u00e0 il sorpasso della popolazione dell'India su quella della Cina? Dove si possono ammirare opere d'arte finanziate da enti pubblici a Seattle? I dati per rispondere a molte, molte domande come queste esistono da qualche parte in Internet - ma non \u00e8 sempre facile trovarli. La piattaforma Open Data, realizzata nell'ambito delle azioni previste dall'Agenda digitale toscana, mette a disposizione dati pubblici riutilizzabili, in formato aperto, favorendo cos\u00ec al massimo la trasparenza e la facilit\u00e0 di accesso alle tante informazioni di cui dispone la Regione Toscana. L'obiettivo \u00e8 quello di pubblicare, attraverso un processo graduale, i tanti dataset la cui titolarit\u00e0 afferisce alla Regione Toscana e ad altre Pubbliche amministrazioni del territorio regionale aderenti alla Rete telematica regionale toscana (RTRT), creando un'infrastruttura che consentir\u00e0 a soggetti pubblici, privati e della societ\u00e0 civile di creare nuovi servizi e applicazioni in grado di migliorare l'accesso all'informazione, la trasparenza e quindi la vita sociale, culturale ed economica dell'intero territorio toscano. Questo sito \u00e8 basato su un potente software open-source di catalogazione dei dati, chiamato CKAN, sviluppato dalla Open Knowledge Foundation. Ogni voce di 'dataset' su CKAN contiene una descrizione dei dati e altre informazioni utili, come i formati disponibili, il detentore, la libert\u00e0 di accesso e riuso, e gli argomenti che i dati affrontano. Gli altri utenti possono migliorare o modificare queste informazioni (CKAN mantiene una cronologia di tutte queste modifiche). CKAN \u00e8 utilizzato per diversi cataloghi di dati su Internet. The Data Hub \u00e8 un catalogo liberamente modificabile e riutilizzabile, nello stile di Wikipedia. Il governo britannico usa CKAN per il portale data.gov.uk, che attualmente conta circa 8000 dataset governativi. I dati pubblici ufficiali della maggior parte dei paesi europei sono raccolti in un catalogo CKAN su publicdata.eu. Esiste anche una lista di questi cataloghi da tutto il mondo su datacatalogs.org, che \u00e8 a sua volta basato su CKAN. La maggior parte dei dati sul portale Open Data della Regione Toscana \u00e8 liberamente accessibile e riutilizzabile: chiunque ha il diritto di utilizzare e riutilizzare i dati nel modo che preferisce. Magari qualcuno prender\u00e0 quel simpatico dataset sulle opere d'arte della citt\u00e0 che avevi trovato tu, e lo aggiunger\u00e0 a una mappa turistica - oppure svilupper\u00e0 una nuova app per il tuo smartphone, che ti aiuter\u00e0 a trovare i monumenti quando visiti la citt\u00e0. Gli open data significano pi\u00f9 impresa, ricerca scientifica collaborativa e pubblica amministrazione trasparente. Puoi approfondire questo argomento nell'Open Data Handbook. La Open Knowledge Foundation \u00e8 una organizzazione no-profit che promuove il sapere libero: lo sviluppo e il miglioramento costante di CKAN \u00e8 uno dei modi per raggiungere questo obiettivo. Se vuoi partecipare alla progettazione o allo sviluppo, unisciti alle liste pubbliche di discussione o sviluppo, o dai un'occhiata al sito della OKFN per scoprire gli altri progetti in corso. CKAN \u00e8 la piattaforma leader mondiale per i portali di dati open-source. CKAN \u00e8 una soluzione software completa e pronta all'uso che rende accessibili e utilizzabili i dati \u2013 fornendo strumenti per ottimizzarne la pubblicazione, la ricerca e l'utilizzo (inclusa l'archiviazione dei dati e la disponibilit\u00e0 di solide API). CKAN si rivolge alle organizzazioni che pubblicano dati (governi nazionali e locali, aziende ed istituzioni) e desiderano renderli aperti e accessibili a tutti. CKAN \u00e8 usato da governi e gruppi di utenti in tutto il mondo per gestire una vasta serie di portali di dati di enti ufficiali e di comunit\u00e0, tra cui portali per governi locali, nazionali e internazionali, come data.gov.uk nel Regno Unito e publicdata.eu dell'Unione Europea, dados.gov.br in Brasile, portali di governo dell'Olanda e dei Paesi Bassi, oltre a siti di amministrazione cittadine e municipali negli USA, nel Regno Unito, Argentina, Finlandia e altri paesi.

It aims to provide Australian-based astronomers with a mechanism through which they can easily collaborate and share data while protecting their data access rights. It facilitates the process of data publishing and indeed encourages it. The platform provides three modes of data publishing. The first mode is limited data publishing within a science team. In this mode, the system provides small to moderate teams with a private data sharing platform, with the datasets only accessible to team members. The platform offers features such as easy to use programmatical access to the data repository via RESTful APIs, and fast access from gSTAR as the preferred processing platform. To ensure the data quality in preparation for a public data release, the system enforces a standard metadata model on the added data products based on the standard TAPObs metadata model. The second mode is public data publishing, where the data is accessible to the wider astronomy community. Through the requirement that a detailed metadata model exists for each data product, the process of moving data products between the two publishing modes is seamless with minimal effort. This significantly facilitates the process of data publishing. Each team can fully determine when they want their data to be published to the astronomy community. The system also supports using digital object identifiers (DOIs) as a reference for the published data products (or product catalogues). The third mode is the managed data publishing mode. This mode aims mainly to help to publish datasets associated with a publication. In this mode, the gSTAR data management team will assist the dataset owner to prepare and publish their dataset.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [5.1737773, 52.1445592]}, "properties": {"id": "0d284869-49b6-4d04-a799-9c40ffa33012", "name": "knmi-data-platform", "title": "KNMI Data Platform", "url": "https://dataplatform.knmi.nl", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/knmi-data-platform", "state": "active", "description": "We provide open access to datasets maintained or generated by the KNMI on weather, climate and seismology.

The Spatial Hub collects together data on a whole host of topics from local authorities and other partner organisations, transforms and joins it all together to form Scotland-wide datasets and publishes them in different ways for the rest of the data community to access and use. This can save each of these organisations a great deal of time, money and effort in developing their own data sharing solutions and also begins to help standardise much of the data and how it is maintained and shared. Scottish local government creates masses of data in the course of providing public services and delivering Scottish Government policy. Most of this data is collected for a single purpose, with no standardisation or thought about how it could be better used, especially for differing purposes. The Spatial Hub copies the blueprint and successes of the One Scotland Gazetteer \u2013 Scotland\u2019s national address and street register, bringing much of this important and valuable local government (and National Park authority) data together to make it more useful, accessible and valuable to the entire data community.

In developing regions, data on agriculture will be the most needed because the sector is the basis of livelihoods and national economy. Unfortunately, agriculture is among the least digitalized of all sectors, even in the developed world. There is thus mismatch in availing a technology to those who need it the most. However, the recent surge in digital technologies is transforming agriculture in many places that will facilitate its diffusion and scaling towards the developing regions. Ethiopia is one of the proponents of digital economy reflected through its \u201cDigital Ethiopia 2025\u201d national strategy, which is set to transform the country's national economy through four major sectoral pathways including agriculture, manufacturing, IT-enabled services and the tourism. There is tremendous effort to not only digitalize sectors and systems but also to benefit from advanced analytics to guide the countries various growth and development initiatives. The recent effort in the development of the \u201cNational Digital Agricultural Extension and Advisory Services Roadmap to 2030\u201d is a clear indication of the country\u2019s commitment to transform its agriculture through digital solutions. However, the expected rapid transformation of the Ethiopian agriculture guided by digital solutions can be challenged. As witnessed during various workshops and based on a recent assessment by the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT and partners in Ethiopia, there is a serious challenge related to the availability of quality and standard data in an organized manner. Because of this gap, there is duplication of effort and wastage of time and resources. In addition, bringing different datasets into an integrated system is complex because of different standards and formats used and in most cases data are not georeferenced. For instance, various organizations and stakeholders in the country have collected voluminous data related to agriculture, environment, and infrastructure. The Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) has collected data on soils. The Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) has been collecting data related agricultural experiment since the 1960s. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) has been collecting data on natural resources and agriculture for more than 50 years. The Central statistical Agency (CSA) has been collecting census data on crop yield and other aspects for many decades. The National Meteorological Authority is the custodian of time-series and predicted climate/weather data. The Geospatial Information Institute (GII) holds tremendous aerial photograph and satellite data. However, these data are not integrated, are not available in a standardized form to share and even most are not accessible due to different reasons. The seriousness of the matter is that even Directorates within one Ministry do not know what each other has that precludes the possibility to share. For instance, the National Soil Information System (NSIS) at the Soil Resource Information and Mapping Directorate and the National Rural Land Administration Information System (NRLAIS) at the Rural Land Administration and Use Directorate (both at the MoA) are not yet integrated and cannot share dataset efficiently. Various efforts have been made to harmonize datasets and facilitate storage and data sharing. However, some of them have already failed while some others are still struggling to succeed due to different reasons including lack of champion institution and limited buy-in and capacity of the government to support initiatives, limited cooperation between sectors and among Directorates within sectors, low technological readiness, governance barriers, and data incompatibility. Against the above background, the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research in Africa (AICCRA) project considered development of integrated ag- data hub as one of its key interventions. The project is expected to co-develop a dedicated, and publicly owned and operated - one-stop-shopping national ag-data hub for Ethiopian government policymakers, agrometeorology experts, ag-extension officers, farmers, value chain actors, and other end users (through consolidation, integration and upgrading of the existing systems) that provides all relevant data, insights and analytics needed to make fact-based decisions when conducting agricultural operations.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-87.9090751, 43.0386475]}, "properties": {"id": "3bfcb546-e1e0-41e2-898b-314a96ad7135", "name": "city-of-milwaukee-open-data-portal", "title": "City Of Milwaukee Open Data Portal", "url": "https://data.milwaukee.gov", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/city-of-milwaukee-open-data-portal", "state": "active", "description": "Milwaukee is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin and the fifth-largest city in the Midwestern United States.

Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone, without imposing restrictions such as copyright, patents or other control mechanisms. In this regard, the portal provides users with the License for Open Governance - OGL ROU 1.0, issued in 2014 by the General Secretariat of the Government as an open license model. In order for data to be considered open, at least two conditions must be met: technical: the data is published online in file formats that can be automatically processed using computer programs (machine-readable), which are, as far as possible, available to anyone, free of charge (free and open source software). legal: at the time of publication, a license is attached to the data by which the owner and publisher of the data establishes the conditions for its reuse. In Romania, the legal framework for publishing open data was established by Law no. 109/2007 regarding the reuse of information from public institutions, amended and supplemented by Law no. 299/2015.

Information collected and created through the labor of numerous civil servants, after being used for its intended purpose within the public administration system, is, with rare exceptions, not made available for public use. The information gradually becomes outdated and loses its value. If published in a timely manner, this information could serve society, transforming into valuable raw material for the economy, science, and technology, forming the basis for the creation of new services, and serving as a foundation for citizens to make informed life choices. Until recently, only a few people considered the extremely low \"efficiency\" of state information. However, the realization that such a situation is unacceptable has arrived, and in a relatively short period, the situation with open data in Kyrgyzstan has fundamentally changed \u2013 today, neither the state nor society is willing to tolerate such a low efficiency of state data: The Open Data Portal of the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the key tools for implementing state policy in the field of open data, and it is assigned the role of a system-forming element, the core of the open data ecosystem of the Kyrgyz Republic. Here, on the Portal, the most up-to-date information on open data from state authorities, regional authorities, and other organizations is concentrated, documented datasets and links to published datasets are posted. Communication interfaces are also implemented here for interaction with organizations acting as owners of socially significant data. Currently, the main capabilities of the Open Data Portal are: Relying on the Portal's communication services, we would like to collect comments, suggestions, and recommendations for improving the Portal in order to eliminate shortcomings and form a trajectory for the further development of the Portal. We sincerely hope that the Portal will be able to unite people genuinely interested in building a comfortable, accessible, and oriented environment in Kyrgyzstan towards real personal, social, and economic needs, around the tasks of developing and realizing the socio-economic potential of open government data.\n\n*Translated from Russian*\n\n---\n\n**Original

by public bodies available and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution. Open Data gives everyone access to non-personal government data which can deliver enhanced economic, social, environmental and democratic benefits to all. The Open Data Initiative is designed to benefit society by increasing the amount of governmental data available to the public, promoting enhanced innovation and fair competition. Many of the apps we use on our phones on a daily basis rely on Open Data. Who leaves their house without checking the weather, the time of the next bus or goes to the beach without looking up the water quality, tidal times or parking facilities? Data.gov.ie is the central portal which provides access to all governmental open data. It provides easy access to datasets that are free to use, reuse, and redistribute. The portal is operated by the Government Reform Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Ireland\u2019s Open Data Initiative began in 2014 when we joined the international Open Government Partnership. The Open Data Initiative has been very successful in Ireland and we are currently ranked 2nd in the EU Open Data Maturity assessment. The Open Data Governance Board was established in 2016 to work in the public interest. It leads the Open Data Initiative and oversees the implementation of the Government\u2019s Open Data Strategy. The Board is made up of 10 to 12 representatives from academia, the public service, business, media and civil society. We would really like to hear how you are using Open Data and if you have 10 minutes please complete a short impact assessment survey for us. Share how you are using Open Data by submitting a Showcase which can be featured on the Portal. The Open Data listed in data.gov.ie is published by Government Departments and Public Bodies. Many datasets are individually published and updated by public organisations. Other datasets are harvested daily from existing, domain-specific data catalogues. If you would like to suggest a new dataset to publish, or if you have any comments about existing datasets, please visit the Suggest a Dataset page > If you have any questions or comments about data.gov.ie or Open Data, please contact the Department of Public Expenditure NDP Delivery and Reform at opendata@per.gov.ie > Data.gov.ie is built using CKAN and utilises elements of ckanext-dgu, available at github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0365427, 38.8950368]}, "properties": {"id": "bf2f238f-fa1a-43a1-8b39-4063db5e963b", "name": "department-of-education-open-data-platform", "title": "Department Of Education Open Data Platform", "url": "https://data.ed.gov", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/department-of-education-open-data-platform", "state": "active", "description": "Data.ed.gov is the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s solution for publishing, finding, and accessing our public data profiles.

The website data.depositar.io was created by researchers based on the needs of researchers. For research purposes, you can freely store, find, and reuse research data on this research data repository. Datasets\u2014tables, maps, documents, or other data files\u2014can be quickly uploaded and previewed on this platform. After uploading, the dataset will have a permanent link for public download and citation. We recommend that you fill in detailed metadata for the dataset as much as possible, as this will help them be discovered and used. The user interface of this platform is very intuitive and provides spatiotemporal descriptions and query functions for datasets. In addition, the keywords used by datasets on the research data repository all come from Wikidata! The deposited datasets are semantically interconnected, making them easy to explore and reuse. Research is a team effort, and the research data repository was created for collaborative research! After obtaining a personal account, researchers can create projects and share datasets with each other. Datasets can be restricted to project members only. In the research data repository, the metadata of datasets can also be collaboratively edited. Moreover, different versions are retained when the same dataset is updated and uploaded. When research data is ready for public release, several open license terms are available for selection. Of course, you can also directly contribute the data to the public domain. This research data repository platform is based on CKAN software. CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) is an open-source software for publishing open data and is a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation, supported by many developers and user groups. We have customized and extended the CKAN code to support research data management. Our newly extended features are also released as open source. Currently, the services provided by data.depositar.io are still experimental and can be freely used for academic purposes. The research data repository is a work in progress. The source code and user manual are available online. Any comments and feedback should be sent to data.contact AT depositar.io. This work is carried out at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, with the support of the Institute of Information Science and the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, and is also supported by a research project grant from the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan. This project began with collaborative research with the Research Center for Geographical Information Science (affiliated with the Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences) at Academia Sinica and continues to this day. The development of the research data repository is a team effort. Current or former members of this project team include (in alphabetical order by last name): Chang, Shao-Chuan (Administrative Management); Chuang, Ting-Rei (Principal Investigator); Ho, Ming-Hsuan;

The CalHHS Open Data Handbook is based on and builds upon the New York State Open Data Handbook, and we would like to acknowledge and thank the New York staff who created that document and made it available for public use. The role of the California Health and Human Services Agency is to provide policy leadership and direction to the departments and programs it oversees, to reduce duplication and fragmentation and improve coordination among the departments, to ensure programmatic integrity, and to advance the Governor's priorities on health and human services issues. The Agency coordinates the administration of state and federal programs for public health, health care services, social services, public assistance, health planning and licensing, and rehabilitation. These programs touch the lives of millions of California's most needy and vulnerable residents. The Agency is responsible for balancing the twin imperatives of providing access to essential health and human services for California's most disadvantaged and at-risk residents and managing and controlling costs. The following Departments and Offices are under the direct supervision of the California Health and Human Services Agency: The Agency Secretary also serves as Chair of Covered California, the health benefit exchange established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. The CalHHS Open Data initiative encourages entrepreneurs, and civic coders and developers to use CalHHS data to create applications, products and services to better the health and lives of Californians.

The Agency\u2019s open data efforts, which support data analysis and using existing data to improve state operations, align with the Eureka Institute\u2019s Lean process improvement program and its pilot work in data-driven performance improvement. Open data is public data collected by the state through its routine business activities and published in a format that is easy to search, easy to download and easy to combine with other data sets from other sources; it does not include private or confidential data about individuals. While several state agencies host their own open data portals, data.ca.gov was designed specifically to host open data from more than one agency. GovOps is in the process of linking each of the existing state portals, so that all of the state\u2019s open data sets can be searched from https://data.ca.gov. GovOps hosted its first event, the CA GreenGov Challenge, in 2015 with the launch of its pilot portal. More than 80 citizen coders, some organized as teams, spent two days at the Department of General Services\u2019 riverside headquarters combining data sets from the Department of General Services, CalRecycle and the Air Resources Board and outside sources to develop tools the state could use to make state operations more sustainable. Two of the winning applications are in development to help DGS track the sustainability of supplies the state purchases and how the state is improving the sustainability of its vehicle fleet. GovOps, together with the State Water Resources Control Board and the California Natural Resources Agency, teamed with the White House Council of Environmental Quality to hold a first-of-its-kind water data challenge focused on developing tools for data-driven decision-making around water reliability and resource sustainability in California. From the start, GovOps has partnered with the California Health and Human Services Agency. An early adopter of open data, CHHS developed the state\u2019s first agency-wide open data portal. The portal publishes data sets from the agency\u2019s 12 health and social services departments and offices. The agency has been a leader in using its portal to encourage collaboration among its departments and to leverage its vast data stores to learn more about program outcomes. GovOps will continue to work with its open data partners in state government to make more data available and easier for Californians to use.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-71.060511, 42.3554334]}, "properties": {"id": "f5a75231-7767-4308-9588-520eb14b9fb2", "name": "boston-open-data", "title": "Boston Open Data", "url": "https://data.boston.gov", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/boston-open-data", "state": "active", "description": "Analyze Boston is the City of Boston's open data hub to find facts, figures, and maps related to our lives within the city.

He ordered the construction of the Grand Palace on the east bank of the Chao Phraya River bend because it was a better strategic location than Thonburi, as the Chao Phraya River served as a moat on the west and south sides. The initial area of Bangkok was defined by the original moat on the east side of Thonburi, which is the Khlong Lot canal, stretching from Pak Khlong Talat to the Chao Phraya River near Phra Pinklao Bridge, covering an area of approximately 1.8 square kilometers on Rattanakosin Island. The area where the Grand Palace was built was originally inhabited by Phraya Rachasetthi and Chinese residents, who were ordered to relocate to Sampheng. During the construction of the Grand Palace, Phraya Thammathibodi and Phraya Vichitranavi were appointed as supervisors. The foundation stone laying ceremony was held on Sunday, the 10th waxing day of the 6th lunar month at 54 minutes after dawn (April 21, 1782). The Grand Palace was completed in B.E. 2328 (A.D. 1785), and a coronation ceremony was held according to tradition, along with a celebration of the city, with the new name bestowed upon the city: \u201cKrungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanakosin Mahintharayutthaya Mahadilokphop Noppharatratchathaniburirom Udomratchaniwetmahasathan Amonphimanawatansathit Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit.\u201d Later, during the reign of His Majesty King Mongkut (Rama IV), the word \"Bawornrattanakosin\" was changed to \"Amonrattanakosin.\" And during the time when Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn was Prime Minister, Thonburi Province was merged with Bangkok and renamed \"Bangkok\" on December 14, B.E. 2515 (A.D. 1972). Bangkok Information: - Origin of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration symbol, Bangkok's official tree, the meaning of \"BMA\" and its full name, the merging of Bangkok and Thonburi, information about the Governor of Bangkok, types of Bangkok district divisions, how Bangkok is divided, and the districts and sub-districts of Bangkok.

Therefore, like other public transparency initiatives, it advocates access to information as a right of citizens. Open data has the following characteristics: The Open Data Plan is the instrument for planning and coordinating actions for making data available in open format, with a validity of two years from its publication. It is, therefore, the guiding document for actions to implement and promote the opening of data, complying with quality requirements and with a view to ease of understanding and reuse of information.

It is a simplified service that organizes and standardizes access to public data, prioritizing the reuse of this data and the use of modern technologies. In short, it functions as a large catalog that facilitates the search and use of data published by the bodies and entities of the Executive Branch, allowing its reuse in digital applications developed by society. The Portal contains the public data planned for opening in the Open Data Plans. Throughout the validity of the PDA 2023-2025, the following data will be made available, according to the schedule below: *The public data from these databases are already available.

Governments, businesses, and individuals can use open data to obtain social, economic, or environmental benefits. In order for open data to be useful, it must be made available to the public in an unrestricted format that is compatible for computation, and that is what this Portal aims to do. The data is presented in resources: tables, files, or maps in structured and open formats, such as CSV or JSON, for example. These resources are grouped into datasets according to their nature. In turn, the datasets are classified into categories, according to the scope, or scopes, from which they originate or to which they refer. A resource can only belong to one dataset, but a dataset can belong to more than one category, if applicable. Thus, for example, the \"Poblaci\u00f3\" (Population) dataset contains different resources with demographic data of the city and belongs to the \"Demografia\" (Demography) category (or group), while the \"Pressupostos\" (Budgets) dataset belongs to the \"Economia\" (Economy) and \"Sector P\u00fablic\" (Public Sector) categories and contains resources with data relating to the City Council's budgets. For the implementation of the Open Data Portal, we have used open-source tools installed in containers, dockerized, to facilitate their installation and possible subsequent transfers and scaling. An infrastructure of interconnected containers has been set up that allows the automatic ingestion and transformation of data, as well as its insertion into the Portal in a completely unattended manner and according to an established schedule. Finally, the OpenDChain application, developed at the City Council, has been created, which replicates the data from the Portal to the IPFS distributed file network, to guarantee its availability, and stores the hash in a blockchain to ensure its traceability. The engine of the Portal is the open-source tool CKAN, installed in a docker container and to which some geographic data visualization plugins have been added. The tool has an API interface that allows us to upload and modify data, and its metadata, in an unattended and remote way. The data to be published is extracted from the internal databases of the City Council, and from external websites, such as the AOC Transparency Portal or the meteorology service. The chosen tool has been logstash, also open source. This tool allows you to configure an ETL (pipeline) processing circuit with specialized plugins for each of the three phases: input, filter, and output. The ingestion (input) plugins collect the data at established intervals from the different sources. In this project, we have used plugins for SQL and http sources. The various filtering (filter) plugins adapt the data, if necessary, to the needs of CKAN. Here, for example, date and time data are transformed into the appropriate format, fields are added, or commas are replaced by periods, as needed in each case. Finally, the output plugins upload the data to CKAN through its API, generate a .CSV, and call the OpenDChain API indicating that there is new data. When OpenDChain receives the call from logstash, it replicates the .CSV to the IPFS distributed file network. Once the .CSV is saved, OpenDChain retrieves the hash of the file and saves it in a transaction on the ropsten blockchain, which is one of the test networks of the Ethereum project. Subsequently, using the CKAN API, it modifies the metadata of the dataset with the link to the file on IPFS and the transaction on the blockchain, so that this information is directly accessible from the Open Data Portal.\n\n*Translated from Catalan*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nL'Open Data Institute defineix les dades obertes de la seg\u00fcent manera: Les dades obertes s\u00f3n dades a les quals qualsevol pot accedir, usar i compartir. Governs, empreses i particulars poden usar les dades obertes per obtenir beneficis socials, econ\u00f2mics o mediambientals. Per tal que les dades obertes esdevinguin \u00fatils s\u2019han de posar a disposici\u00f3 del p\u00fablic en un format no restringit i compatible per a la seva computaci\u00f3, i aix\u00f2 \u00e9s el que preten aquest Portal. Les dades es presenten en recursos: taules, fitxers o mapes en formats estructurats i oberts, com CSV o JSON, per exemple. Aquests recursos s'agrupen en conjunts de dades segons la seva naturalesa. A la vegada, els conjunts de dades es classifiquen en categories, segons l'\u00e0mbit, o \u00e0mbits, dels que provenen o a qu\u00e8 fan refer\u00e8ncia. Un recurs nom\u00e9s pot pert\u00e0nyer a un conjunt de dades, per\u00f2 un conjunt de dades pot pert\u00e0nyer a m\u00e9s d'una categoria, si escau. Aix\u00ed, per exemple, el conjunt de dades Poblaci\u00f3 cont\u00e9 diferents recursos amb dades demogr\u00e0fiques de la ciutat, i pertany a la categoria (o grup) Demografia, mentre que el conjunt de dades Pressupostos pertany a les categories Economia i Sector P\u00fablic i cont\u00e9 recursos amb dades relatives als pressupostos de l'Ajuntament. Per la implementaci\u00f3 del Portal de Dades Obertes hem utilitzat eines de codi obert instal\u00b7lades en contenidors, dockeritzades, per tal de facilitar la seva instal\u00b7laci\u00f3 i possibles posteriors trasllats i escalats. S'ha muntat una infraestructura de contenidors interconnectats que permet la ingesti\u00f3 i transformaci\u00f3 autom\u00e0tiques de les dades, aix\u00ed com la seva inserci\u00f3 al Portal de manera totalment desatesa i segons una planificaci\u00f3 establerta. Finalment, s'ha creat l'aplicaci\u00f3 OpenDChain, desenvolupada a l'Ajuntament, que replica les dades del Portal a la xarxa de fitxers distribu\u00efts IPFS, per garantir-ne la disponibilitat, i en guarda el hash a una blockchain, per tal d'assegurar-ne la tra\u00e7abilitat. El motor del Portal \u00e9s l'eina de codi obert CKAN, instal\u00b7lada en un contenidor docker i a la que s'han afegit alguns plugins de visualitzaci\u00f3 de dades geogr\u00e0fiques. L'eina disposa d'una interf\u00edcie API que ens permet pujar-hi i modificar dades, i les seves metadades, de manera desatesa i remota. Les dades a publicar s'extreuen de les bases de dades internes de l'Ajuntament, i de webs externes, com el Portal de Transpar\u00e8ncia de l'AOC o el servei de meteorologia. L'eina triada ha estat el logstash, tamb\u00e9 de codi obert. Aquesta eina permet configurar un circuit de processat ETL (pipeline) amb plugins especialitzats per cadascuna de les tres fases: input, filter i output. Els plugins d'ingesti\u00f3 (input) recullen les dades a intervals establerts des de les diferents fonts. En aquest projecte, hem utilitzat plugins per a fonts SQL i http. Els diversos plugins de filtrat (filter) adapten les dades, si cal, a les necessitats del CKAN. Aqu\u00ed es transformen, per exemple, les dades de data i hora al format adequat, s'afegeixen camps, o se substitueixen comes per punts, segons calgui en cada cas. Finalment, els plugins de sortida (output) pujen les dades al CKAN a trav\u00e9s de la seva API, generen un .CSV i criden l'API de l'OpenDChain indicant que hi ha noves dades. L'OpenDChain, en rebre la crida des del logstash, replica el .CSV a la xarxa de fitxers distribu\u00efts IPFS. Un cop guardat el .CSV, l'OpenDChain recupera el hash del fitxer, i el guarda en una transacci\u00f3 a la blockchain ropsten, que \u00e9s una de les xarxes de test del projecte Ethereum.

It is a further step in the cultural shift within the local public sector. The Municipality understands that opening up data is a value that will accelerate innovation and strengthen the community, considering the growing demand for free data and the technological evolution we are witnessing. The Open Data service aims to provide, free of charge, a large volume of data produced by the Municipality of \u00c1gueda to any citizen or organization that wishes to use it according to their interests. The Open Data are integrated into the Spatial Data Infrastructure of the municipality with access via Geoportal. They are organized by datasets under thematic groups. The data provided follows the provisions of the National Digital Interoperability Regulation, namely in the recommended or mandatory formats. We use a technological ecosystem supported by free and open-source technologies, ensuring interoperability between solutions. We seek to involve the community in this process, as well as schools, academia, research groups, technological communities, and companies, so that this territory, which the municipality promotes, can be analyzed more consistently and from various angles. It is from this perspective that we expect essential feedback from our peers, in the identification of new data that allows them to develop their projects and in the critical evaluation of the data we provide. On the other hand, we look forward to examples or even ideas for the development of applications that benefit the community, new ways of visualizing data, among other products that absorb the data made available. In the scrutiny of the data or in its mining, important information can be derived that allows us to reflect both on decision-making tasks, planning, or even immediate actions, in order to direct energy towards more responsible and simultaneously creative management. These are moments of synergy that are sought, oriented towards a constructive relationship that benefits the community as a whole. In the objectives we set for the provision of data, we want them to be comprehensive in the domain of geospatial information, respecting what is protected by the municipality. We foresee the possibility of integrating data from other organizations and citizens, local or regional, that enrich the data provided. We distribute the data in various formats and operate with a license that guarantees its free use and reuse so that more value is built. The distributed data guarantees privacy and protection of personal data. The technological solution adopted focused on the CKAN data management system. It is a web-based system that allows the storage and distribution of data, namely spreadsheets and content from the database. It is a solution maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation. We have planned actions to disseminate open data and build based on open data, data that we also intend to inventory and disseminate in order to build levels of maturity that observe the state of the digital culture. We expect gains in digital literacy with the aforementioned actions. In economic terms, we expect growth in the digital sector, based on an increasingly better network infrastructure, with the emergence of new companies and the evolution of existing ones.\n\n*Translated from Portuguese*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nO servi\u00e7o de Dados Abertos \u00e9 um passo mais, no compromisso de uma governa\u00e7\u00e3o aberta e de transpar\u00eancia que o Munic\u00edpio de \u00c1gueda realiza. \u00c9 um passo mais na mudan\u00e7a de cultura no setor p\u00fablico local.

Natural Resources (AANR) policy laboratory in the Philippines. We aim to bridge the gap between research and public policymaking. In most instances, research results do not speak for themselves. Policymakers and development practitioners rely on objective and meaningful interpretations of evidence to arrive at actionable solutions to challenges faced by communities. In turn, policy interventions need to be scientifically informed to be effective (Schaal, 2017). If the voluminous science-based information generated by the National Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development Network (NAARRDN) of DOST-PCAARRD are to be optimally utilized for policy decision-making, capacities need to be strengthened in the regions for policy actors and stakeholders to take part in the uptake of research evidence into policy and development practice. CPAf-UPLB\u2019s Center for Strategic Planning and Policy Studies (CSPPS) proposes the establishment of a policy laboratory that will not only build capacities on policy analysis and advocacy but also promote engagement of various stakeholders in an inclusive co-production of solutions for the attainment of development goals of communities. The DIP Lab will be valuable to DOST-PCAARRD\u2019s policy analysis and advocacy initiatives. The DIP Lab for instance could provide support in the whole advocacy process such as in the stakeholders\u2019 consultation and analysis, consensus building, and translating research results into advocacy agenda. Some of the policy advocacy projects supported by DOST-PCAARRD that would benefit from the policy lab are on the adoption of watershed ecosystem framework in land use planning, ecotourism-based management for Laguna de Bay, and more appropriate and simplified regulation for sustainable utilization of almaciga resin. The policy lab would also support DOST-PCAARRD\u2019s vision to create a critical mass of researchers in the regions who will engage in policy design and advocacy through training and mentoring programs. In addition, the DIP Lab will work complementarily with the Socio-Economics Research and Data Analytics Centers (SERDACs) in the Region and the Socio-Economics Research and Data Analytics Laboratory (SERDAL) in UPLB. While SERDAL will focus on employing data analytics in forecasting and development of other models for the agriculture and aquatic industries, the Policy Lab will center on using such models for policy advocacy or advisories. On the other hand, any needs for data analytics shall be provided by SERDAL to the DIP Lab for better policy design and as support to the latter\u2019s capacity development component. Meanwhile, SERDACs will be the DIP lab\u2019s partners in its capacity development initiatives in different regions of the country. Ultimately, the policy lab envisions to establish teams set up specifically for innovative activities for public policymaking. Such teams are deemed as a mix of designers, researchers, policymakers, experts, and other stakeholders working on short-term and long-term, small and large projects to transform evidence to policy at different levels. Given the realities of our times, the policy lab will be prepared to not only be a conducive physical space set up for the purpose of conducting workshops or other activities for policymaking, but also, a facility that is capable of having virtual activities. This policy lab will also be a \u201chub\u201d for data, digital tools, and design ideas for effective and science-informed policymaking. This project aims to enhance the capacities of producers and consumers of AANR research to transform sound evidence into innovative solutions for societal development. Specifically, it aims to: Develop a system of curating, retrieving, analyzing, transforming, and sharing policy data into knowledge resources that could guide policy research and decision making for the development of the AANR Sector; Enhance capacities of the DOST-PCAARRD\u2019s NAARRDN in policy analysis and advocacy; Reinforce the implementing strategies of the DOST-PCAARRD-funded policy analysis and advocacy projects Create a neutral space that encourages collaborative learning and co-creation of policy innovations among experts, policy decision-makers, community organizations, and other stakeholders; and Cultivate intellectual and public discourse, as well as fresh thinking to influence policies.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [26.0863631, 44.4378654]}, "properties": {"id": "2717ab5f-0bca-4e29-bf28-66778c39086d", "name": "gerontomics-aging-research-data", "title": "GERONTOMICS Aging Research Data", "url": "https://ckan.dev.aging-research.group", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/gerontomics-aging-research-data", "state": "active", "description": "Starting 02.09.2016, the Institute of Biochemistry of the Romanian Academy is implementing the project \u201cMulti-omics prediction system for prioritization of gerontological interventions\u201d, co-funded through European Fund for Regional Development, in accordance with the funding contract signed by the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research. The total funding for the project is 8.524.757,50 lei, of which 8.502.557,50 lei represent non-reimbursable funding. The project\u2019s duration is 48 months. The general strategic goal of the project is in accordance with the objectives and priorities of the 2014-2020 Competitiveness Operational Programme \u2013 Priority Axis 1 \u2013 Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RD&I) to support of Economic Competitiveness and Business Development \u2013 Action 1.1.4 Attracting high-level personnel from abroad in order to enhance the RD capacity. The aging of the population (i.e., the increase in average lifespan) is one of the major biomedical problems, challenging us nationally and also internationally. This increase in lifespan, which is mostly due to improvements in the healthcare system and is to be applauded, does not necessarily guarantee healthy aging and an increase in healthspan. By integrating multiple aging models (from different species and various experimental models), which capture holistically the differences between the \u201enormal\u201d and \u201eunbalanced\u201d states of the biologic system, the project aims to analyse with an improved accuracy the mechanisms that lie behind aging. Such an approach is promising for the understanding of the multiple facets of aging, including ways to extend healthspan, by minimizing the statistical noise intrinsic to any individual screening. From a technological point of view, the employed methods in this project (integrative multi-models, large-scale data analysis, network-based analysis methods, deep neural nets) are modern and represent the state-of-the-art in the field. The project is computationally intensive and will result in the development of new algorithms, statistical metrics and in the application of AI and machine learning methods to biological problems. By doing a holistic analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, epigennomics and GWAS datasets from humans and model organisms the project has the applicative aim to enhance our understanding of the biology of aging, with the final goal to create an integrative, multi-omics prediction platform for prioritization of gerontological interventions. Destined mainly for research organisations, but also for pharmaceutical companies focused on aging research, we expect that the final product of this project will help reduce research costs (both financial and time-related), encourage aging research and channel experimental gerontological studies (in vitro or with animal models) towards a higher efficiency. Overall, the project will contribute directly by generating fundamental knowledge in aging research. From this point of view, both cost reduction in gerontology and generating new hypotheses about aging are areas of great interest for the \u201eHealthy aging, lifestyle and public health\u201d direction, one of the current priorities of the healthcare system. In particular, the study of aging will contribute to the development of preventive therapies, which target lifespan extension, and more importantly healthspan (defined as the active, healthy and productive period in a person\u2019s life). Both objectives have the potential to greatly impact the life quality in our society, and in particular for the elderly.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-68.8446177, -32.8894155]}, "properties": {"id": "458541ce-3831-4091-ae88-f46bb0644d38", "name": "open-data-portal-of-the-city-of-mendoza", "title": "Open Data Portal Of The City Of Mendoza", "url": "https://ckan.ciudaddemendoza.gob.ar", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/open-data-portal-of-the-city-of-mendoza", "state": "active", "description": "Learn the step-by-step process to start downloading the open data of the City of Mendoza.

Subsequently, due to the Comptroller General's Department, Ministry of Finance, shifting its mission from control and operation to supervision, consultation, advice, promotion, and support, as well as decentralizing financial and fiscal authority to various government agencies and regions, and also consolidating agencies with similar missions and responsibilities into a single government agency with a higher status than a division, the division of government agencies within the Comptroller General's Department, Ministry of Finance, was reorganized to facilitate government operations with greater flexibility, efficiency, appropriateness, and consistency with the nature of the work. Furthermore, as the division of government agencies within the department is enacted as a Royal Decree under Section 8, Paragraph 4 of the Government Administration Act B.E. 2534 (1991), the \"State Enterprise Division\" was transformed into the \"Bureau of State Enterprises and Government Securities\" according to the Royal Decree on the Division of Government Agencies of the Comptroller General's Department, Ministry of Finance, B.E. 2538 (1995). Following the economic crisis, the government placed great importance on developing state enterprises to be more efficient, which would lead to increasing the competitiveness of state enterprises and creating added value for state assets. Therefore, the Bureau of State Enterprises and Government Securities (BSE), which is the agency responsible for supervising the implementation of state enterprise administration and development policies in accordance with government policies, is a very important agency. In order to enable the Bureau of State Enterprises and Government Securities to be more capable of accomplishing its mission effectively, the \u201cBureau of State Enterprises and Government Securities\u201d was upgraded to the \u201cState Enterprise Policy Office,\u201d with the status of a department-level agency, according to the Ministry, Bureau, and Department Improvement Act B.E. 2545 (2002) on October 3, 2002.\n\n*Translated from Thai*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e2a\u0e04\u0e23.

This is a prototype catalog of the Munich Digital Twin based on the \"Smart District Data Infrastructure\" (SDDI) concept. The concept is being developed at the Chair of Geoinformatics, Technical University of Munich. Structuring of the Datasets: The assignment of the datasets into groups, as well as the number and division of the groups themselves, is the result of long and intensive considerations. The division into three main groups enables a simple search for datasets, as well as an easily comprehensible assignment to specific topic areas. Links between individual datasets are possible through a special extension and facilitate navigation. Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI): The catalog platform is part of the SDDI concept, which is used for data structuring in the field of Smart Cities and Regions. The idea of SDDI arose in the course of the Europe-wide Smart Sustainable Districts project at the Chair of Geoinformatics at TUM, and is also the result of very long and extensive considerations. At the heart of the SDDI is the catalog platform, which manages the metadata of the individual datasets and provides an overview of the total inventory of all available data. Technical Implementation: The technical implementation of the catalog platform is based on the open-source software CKAN http://ckan.org/. For some of the functionalities, extensions are used, which on the one hand come from the official CKAN extension library, and on the other hand were developed at the Chair of Geoinformatics at TUM. The catalog platform is operated in the backend via a PostgreSQL database http://postgresql.org/, which also enables the storage and processing of spatial data.

A data catalogue and a WebGIS application allow to easily discover and view data and metadata. Data can be downloaded directly via link to the publishing data repository. New submissions to the catalogue are evaluated for publication using the following criteria. PERMAFROST FOCUS: Data directly or indirectly measures and/or classifies permafrost characteristics in the Arctic, Antarctica, or mountain permafrost areas, for example soil temperatures, ground ice content, land cover, topography and many more. HIGH SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: The data addresses an important problem or critical barrier to progress in the field of permafrost research. It provides, for example, circum-arctic coverage, is important to many different disciplines, and shows new or improved measurements. OPEN ACCESS: Metadata and data are accessible and published in a repository. HIGH QUALITY: Data is validated. Metadata reports an accuracy assessment. METADATA: Metadata adequately describes the processing of the data and the data is reproducible with the given metadata.

It is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canada and implemented from 2015 to 2020. The SESMIM project is one of the first and largest projects implemented in Mongolia under the Canadian government's assistance program. This project is implemented by AgriTeam Canada Consulting Ltd., based in Canada, which has established a representative office in Mongolia to manage the project's operations. During the project's implementation, the Government of Alberta, the University of Alberta (U of A), the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary (SPP-UC), and other technical assistance organizations, as well as leading Canadian extractive sector experts and professionals, are sharing their knowledge and experience in their respective fields. The SESMIM project will support transparent and sustainable extractive sector governance by providing support for policy coordination and improvement of the legal environment in areas such as strategic revenue management, extractive sector governance, special permits, mine closure, environmental management, climate change, cadastre, and gender, as well as capacity building and strengthening. The project is working closely with Mongolia's Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, the Ministry of Finance, as well as the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority and the General Taxation Authority, and is implementing planned activities such as strengthening the capacity of government and non-government organizations through study tours to Canada, internship programs, and training seminars, and introducing leading Canadian practices to Mongolia.\n\n*Translated from Russian*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\n\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b

The project aims to promote the availability of municipal data to society in reusable formats for the development of the information society, to foster transparency and democratic participation, and to enable companies to generate wealth and employment by using this public data to develop applications. The portal is characterized by offering datasets in Open Linked Data, with the maximum 5-star level of reusability, as recommended by the W3C. The main objective of this project, with regard to the Re-use of Public Sector Information (RISP), is to enhance the public availability of data held by Public Administrations, which is of interest to citizens and the infomediary sector, through the implementation of a strategy and an Open Data portal, improving transparency and enabling the generation of value through the development of new services based on them. As a result, the data platform allows: Citizens to search for and visualize the information they need. Developers to access the data for reuse. Local entities to easily generate websites and analytics based on their data infrastructure. As a premise in this project, each of the datasets on the portal will be offered following the recommendations of the W3C, as well as regional and state regulations, in order to obtain the maximum levels of reuse, using open representation formats for them. The Badajoz Provincial Council's open data portal (http://opendata.dip-badajoz.es) has been developed using open source tools. The SPARQL endpoint and the semantic database are supported by the Virtuoso Opensource semantic server, in its version 6.01. The resources, identified by their URIs, are returned in RDF using a proprietary application. The web architecture is based on CKAN, a specific platform for the storage and dissemination of open data supported by the Open Knowledge Foundation.\n\n*Translated from Spanish*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nEl portal Opendata de la provincia de Badajoz es una iniciativa de la Diputaci\u00f3n Provincial de Badajoz para hacer p\u00fablicos sus datos y documentos de cara al inter\u00e9s de ciudadanos y empresas.

Currently, a beta version of the Portal is available to internet users. The portal provides datasets to users online. This allows any researcher or professor/student of higher educational institutions to explore, download, and use SGM RAS data for research or educational purposes. The datasets on the Portal correspond to the main collections of the Museum. Currently, they include 82,949 exhibits and 98,376 items. To ensure the uniqueness of each dataset, it is planned to use DOI assignment technology in the near future. Thus, datasets with a DOI will be uniquely identified and will have a permanent link for mentioning in internet and scientific publications. Currently, when using the Museum's collection data, it is necessary to refer to the Open Data Portal of the Vernadsky State Geological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences http://data.sgm.ru. The work is carried out within the framework of the Program of Fundamental Scientific Research of State Academies of Sciences for 2013 \u2013 2020.

Envisioned by Municipal Decree No. 54,779/2014, the CMDB aims to disseminate a listing of all databases produced by the bodies and entities of the municipal administration. Currently, the Municipal Database Catalog is regulated by Municipal Decree No. 63,463/2024. Organized by the Integrity Promotion Coordination (COPI) of the Municipal Comptroller General (CGM-SP) in conjunction with the bodies and entities of the City Hall, the Catalog presents to the citizens a relationship with all the available data produced by the City Hall. From the CMDB, the S\u00e3o Paulo City Hall began to work on a free platform that would bring together its databases and descriptions, allowing easy access and research by programmers, journalists, researchers, and citizens in general. This led to CKAN (The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network), a tool already adopted in the largest cities in the world, for the construction of this Open Data Portal, which confers even greater transparency to municipal data. CKAN is free, open-source, and specific to the development of data catalogs. Used by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and 139 other governments worldwide, including national and local administrations, it was customized for the S\u00e3o Paulo City Hall by Prodam, the Municipality's Information and Communication Technology Company, based on the evolution of the work developed by the Municipal Comptroller General. Through CKAN, each unit of the municipal administration will be able to insert its databases and maintain a constant flow of updates. Gradually, all municipal databases will appear in this Open Data Portal. Questions about the Portal or suggestions for improvements?

The device will be developed as an upgrade to the WAVY drifter conceived by the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, which was used to measure the surface circulation forced by wave breaking, including detailed structure of rip and the littoral drift currents. The philosophy of the WAVY drifter will essentially be respected: Given the low influence of wind upon the drifters\u2019 displacements, MELOA will provide a cheap and effective way to monitor surface currents and surface dynamic features anywhere in the World Ocean. Through equipping the drifters with thermistors at two different levels, the possibility is open for monitoring \u201cnear-skin temperature\u201d and nearsurface vertical temperature gradients, which will be invaluable for calibration/validation of satellite derived SST fields. Running since 2017, MELOA (Multi-purpose/Multi-sensor Extra Light Oceanography Apparatus) is an H2020 project that is developing an innovative family of products, WAVY drifter units, allowing for a low-cost, easily deployable, high versatility, and low maintenance system for in-situ measurements for marine environments. Focused on covering marine observation gaps, the WAVYs will increase the availability of in-situ data for coastal and open ocean zones. The MELOA project is developing the first prototypes for the different WAVY units configurations, and engaging with the marine community to test them in different marine environments, collecting and making available the data from the test campaigns and building, on top of this data, the first products and services to showcase the usefulness of the WAVY data. Initially planned to end by 2021, the project received an extension until February 2022, as the MELOA team was forced to interrupt the activities involving the development and testing of the WAVY drifters and cancelled all community international events during 2020. With this extension, the team will have enough time to achieve the goals set for the development of the family of WAVY drifters.

Governments, universities, and organizations in general have a large amount of basic data that can be of economic and social value to society as a whole.

Information about the available data is structured into twelve different categories ranging from biodiversity to transport, including science, justice, health, education, agriculture, tourism, and so on. Work is underway to enable rapid navigation through the categories and to achieve the greatest accessibility of the data. To help access the data provided in different languages, Ambar has a multilingual search interface.

There is a lot of data on the internet that can answer these and similar questions \u2013 but finding it is not always easy. OpenData.HRO is a web application that serves as a catalog for many useful datasets. The application is operated by the Hanseatic and University City of Rostock, which is also the owner and publisher of the data. You can use the application to search for, view, and download data for yourself and/or others. Depending on the type of dataset, OpenData.HRO also offers it as database content, providing you with some useful statistical and/or visualization tools. The present web application is based on the powerful open-source software CKAN, maintained and further developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation. Each dataset in CKAN consists of a description of the contained data as well as the data itself. The description includes important information such as the type of file formats in which the data is offered, the license under which it is provided, and the categories and subject areas to which it is assigned. The data and their descriptions can be updated or supplemented, with CKAN always recording all changes by means of automatic versioning. CKAN is used by a large number of data catalogs on the internet. The Data Hub, for example, is a publicly editable data catalog in the Wikipedia style. The British government uses CKAN to operate data.gov.uk \u2013 currently with approximately 8,000 government datasets. The official public data of most European countries are listed in the CKAN catalog on europeandataportal.eu. You can find a complete list of catalogs like this on dataportals.org, a page that is also operated with CKAN. Unless otherwise stated, the data on OpenData.HRO are subject to a free license. This means that you can freely use and exploit the data in compliance with the conditions set out in the terms of use (and they are anything but restrictive). Perhaps you would like to use the data on art in public spaces to build a smartphone app that helps to make a tour of Rostock culturally sophisticated? Go for it! Open Data promotes entrepreneurship, collaborative science, and transparent administration. You can learn more about Open Data in the Open Data Handbook. The Open Knowledge Foundation is a non-profit organization for the promotion of open knowledge: developing and improving CKAN is one of the ways to achieve this. If you would like to contribute to CKAN with design or code, you can join the developer mailing lists or visit the OKFN pages to learn more about CKAN and other projects.\n\n*Translated from German*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nWo genau war nochmal die Grundschule, die Ihrem zu Hause am n\u00e4chsten ist und die Ihre Kinder gut erreichen k\u00f6nnen, ohne dabei viele Stra\u00dfen \u00fcberqueren zu m\u00fcssen?

The reason is actually very simple, because credible data is the key to the quality of development and good governance. Public policy, public services, law enforcement, government performance monitoring, and business opportunities all require credible data. Unfortunately, in practice, data is still often not managed seriously. There are still many cases where there are data that not only have various versions, but often also contradict each other. The One Data Initiative, or commonly called One Data Indonesia, is one of the Indonesian government's initiatives that tries to fix problems in the implementation and management of government data. The development of this initiative is also overseen by the Open Government Indonesia Action Plan. Along with welcoming International Open Data Day which falls on March 4, 2017, As an initiative that is being promoted by the central government regarding data governance reform within the Indonesian government, One Data Indonesia is an initiative that is expected to help the integration of planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and control of development between the central government and the regions, and at the next level is the disclosure of government data that can be used by the community. In addition, the implementation of One Data is also expected to accelerate the implementation of the Electronic-Based Government System (SPBE/E-government) which is being prepared, both in terms of regulations and operational stages, by a number of related agencies involving the Presidential Staff Office, the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, the Ministry of PAN & RB, the Ministry of Communication and Informatics, and the State Administration Institution. In principle, Satu Data Indonesia strives to encourage better government data governance. Good data governance is highly dependent on quality and consistency in data management. For this reason, Satu Data Indonesia defines good data governance into three main principles. The three main principles that will be encouraged through the One Data Indonesia policy are: (i) a single standard data standard, (ii) one standard metadata, and (iii) data interoperability. With the application of these principles, it is hoped that the One Data policy will be able to realize an accountable, accurate, integrated, up-to-date, and open data management system. These three principles will be implemented through the Presidential Regulation on One Data that we are currently compiling. Currently, the initiation of One Data has reached the finalization stage of the preparation of the Presidential Regulation on One Data Indonesia. If it has been passed, the Presidential Regulation on One Data Indonesia is expected to stimulate efforts to improve government data governance in Indonesia. This means that the use of data will be more structured and will improve the quality of policies and public services in Indonesia as well. In addition, to ensure the smooth implementation later, pilot activities are also being carried out in seven ministries, institutions and also seven local governments. At the central government level, the One Data Initiative is currently being pilotedn in several Ministries, including the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. At the local government level, the implementation of One Data Indonesia has been piloted in several pilot areas, including DKI Jakarta Province, Demak Regency, Bojonegoro Regency, Semarang City, Banda Aceh City, Mojokerto City, and Pontianak City. There are actually several priorities that can be resolved in order to facilitate the implementation of One Data Indonesia. First, harmonization between the role of Presidential Regulations (Perpres) and Regional Regulations (Perda). Second, finding a clear business process for the implementation of One Data Indonesia both in the Ministries/Institutions of a region. Third, the integration of other Ministries/Institutions data portals in one portal, to facilitate access and use of data by the public. There are several things that are still challenges for the implementation of One Data in Indonesia. One of them is the process of ratifying the Presidential Regulation on One Data Indonesia which requires coordination with various stakeholders which takes a long time. In addition, there are several policies related to statistics, which need to be adjusted to the context of data governance reform within the current government. One of them is Law No. 16 of 1997 concerning Statistics which still defines data only in the form of numbers, so that other forms of data such as spatial data are not included in it. In addition, the reluctance of many parties to integrate cross-sectoral data management within the government is also an obstacle. Where there are various types of data in each sector, but without any integration with other sectors. Finally, one of the things that hinders the implementation of this initiative according to the One Data Indonesia team is the existence of non-tax state revenue (PNPB) collected from data requests. This severely limits access to open data that should be easily and free of charge accessible to the public.\n\nDemak Regency Open Data Portal", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [95.9412834, 5.1143002]}, "properties": {"id": "6655dc64-11ff-414c-985e-93e1e55da105", "name": "pidie-regency-open-data", "title": "Pidie Regency Open Data", "url": "https://data.pidiekab.go.id", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/pidie-regency-open-data", "state": "active", "description": "In accordance with the mandate of Presidential Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia No. 39 of 2019 concerning One Data Indonesia, the One Data Indonesia program facilitates the delivery of government data information to produce accurate, up-to-date, and integrated data that is accountable, easily accessible, and shareable between the central and regional governments through compliance with data standards, metadata, data interoperability, the use of reference codes, and master data.

The fundamental premise of the global \"Open Data\" movement rests on the value generated from the reuse of public data for various purposes. The great added value resulting from open data, whether in terms of greater transparency of municipal activity or general value for Academia and for citizens and companies, has, therefore, mobilized the public sector globally to develop strategies in this regard. In this context, the Municipality of Porto believes that in order to implement an impactful strategy that promotes the sustainable development of an open data platform, it is necessary to adopt a holistic and city-wide vision. Based on this premise, the Municipality has defined a Strategic Plan for Data Valorization of the Municipality of Porto, which aims to ensure a real paradigm shift at the municipal level in the way data is managed and processed in its context. Current Open Data Paradigm The growing informational demands that are felt, resulting from the advent of information technologies, have a strong impact on cities, not only due to the ever-increasing volume of data produced and available that needs to be managed and leveraged to improve municipal management, but also due to the continuous evolution of data analysis, exploration and processing technologies. The task at hand is not only about modernizing the technological structure, adapting it to systems and mechanisms that are constantly being updated, but, above all, seeking the continuous improvement of services provided to citizens, companies and institutions. The availability and reuse of public sector data for private purposes or by Research & Development institutions can be an important contribution to the development of new services based on innovative ways of combining and using that same data, stimulating economic growth, the production of scientific knowledge and promoting social intervention. Vision of the Municipality of Porto regarding the current Open Data paradigm Among the values that guide the activity and culture of the Municipality of Porto, citizen orientation, continuous improvement and innovation stand out. In this context, and bearing in mind the growing importance assumed by data, information and the knowledge that can be generated from it, the Municipality of Porto intends to respond to the challenge of the current open data paradigm. Porto Municipality Open Data Portal In order to generate value through the provision of information that can be used and combined to generate knowledge by the most diverse agents in the city, the Municipality of Porto will implement an Open Data Portal. Therefore, the intention is that the Portal will not only be a data repository, but also a collaborative interface and active participation platform between the Municipality, citizens, companies, Academia, institutions and other organizations and entities from the most diverse areas of intervention, in a more transparent and participatory governance strategy on the part of the city. This data, much of it georeferenced, is extremely useful, constituting support for municipal activity, a tool to support decision-making, the design of well-informed and supported policies and strategies, in line with the objective of creating smart, inclusive and sustainable cities, embodied in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Scope and objectives of this strategic document This document aims to systematize the guiding principles upstream of the creation of the Porto Municipality Open Data Portal, contextualizing them in the current paradigm of providing data to citizens, Academia, companies and other entities as a way to enhance governmental transparency and improve the participation of agents in the process of building knowledge about the city. 1) The open data policy Information is a necessity for any sector of human activity. Data/information is one of the main assets of organizations, regardless of their scope of activity. The transformation of information into knowledge is currently considered a factor of primary importance for the competitiveness of companies, institutions and territories. The European Union, within the scope of the Digital Agenda for Europe, has been encouraging Member States to adopt open data initiatives. The reasons are due to the fact that: 2) Vision and strategy of the Municipality of Porto regarding open data As a contribution to the implementation of European and national strategies in terms of public transparency, the process of making open data available to city agents by the Municipality of Porto has the following fundamental objectives: In this context, the Vision of the Municipality of Porto in this regard consists of maximizing the opportunities that arise from the provision and use of data and information from the Municipality, thus contributing to increasing and promoting the competitiveness of the city of Porto and the region transversally, for visiting, residing, studying, attracting and conducting business in the national and international market. 3) The Porto Municipality Open Data Portal This Portal is based on the principles of open data and is made available by the Municipality of Porto with the aim of generating value for society. Open data reflects greater transparency of the Municipality, more active participation of the citizen and potentiates the development of better and new private products and services. This Portal will be a driver of innovation, improvement of municipal services and the creation of knowledge with the combination of different data, assuming a role of great interest for the city. The Open Data Portal was developed by the Municipality of Porto, using the open source CKAN platform. Target audience The open data of the city of Porto is intended for citizens (residents), entrepreneurs, tourists, researchers, students, and the community of programmers who intend to use them in the implementation of applications. What exists on the Portal? The Portal provides a catalog of metadata that aims to allow access to data from the Municipality of Porto or data shared by third parties, these being available in formats for both traditional human reading and by machines. The Portal also has a space for disseminating a selection of applications developed based on the data made available on it. How to participate in the Portal One of the objectives of the Portal is to encourage the participation of citizens, Academia and companies through the presentation of suggestions regarding publication, correction of detected errors, sharing of their own data and dissemination of the uses they make with the data. For this purpose, please contact: dados@cm-porto.pt Access to the data can be made by any anonymous User without the need to register on the Portal.\n\n*Translated from Portuguese*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o Plano de Gest\u00e3o e Valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados do Munic\u00edpio do Porto A premissa fundamental do movimento global \"Dados Abertos\" assenta no valor gerado a partir da reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados p\u00fablicos para v\u00e1rios fins. O grande valor acrescentado decorrente dos dados abertos, seja no \u00e2mbito de maior transpar\u00eancia da atividade municipal ou de geral valor para a Academia e para os cidad\u00e3os e empresas, tem, portanto, mobilizado o setor p\u00fablico a n\u00edvel global a desenvolver estrat\u00e9gias neste sentido. Neste contexto, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto acredita que para implementar uma estrat\u00e9gia de impacto, que promova o desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel de uma plataforma de dados abertos, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio adotar uma vis\u00e3o hol\u00edstica e transversal a toda a cidade. Assente nessa premissa, o Munic\u00edpio definiu um Plano Estrat\u00e9gico de Valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados do Muncipio do Porto. que visa garantir uma verdadeira altera\u00e7\u00e3o de paradigma a n\u00edvel municipal na forma como os dados s\u00e3o geridos e processados no seu contexto.

O exerc\u00edcio que se coloca n\u00e3o diz respeito apenas \u00e0 moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura tecnol\u00f3gica, adequando-a aos sistemas e mecanismos que se encontram em constante atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o, mas, e sobretudo, procurar a melhoria cont\u00ednua dos servi\u00e7os prestados aos cidad\u00e3os, empresas e institui\u00e7\u00f5es. A disponibilidade e reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados do setor p\u00fablico para fins privados ou por parte das institui\u00e7\u00f5es de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o & Desenvolvimento pode constituir um importante contributo para o desenvolvimento de novos servi\u00e7os baseados em modos inovadores de combinar e utilizar esses mesmos dados, estimulando o crescimento econ\u00f3mico, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimento cient\u00edfico e promovendo a interven\u00e7\u00e3o social. Vis\u00e3o do Munic\u00edpio do Porto quanto ao atual paradigma do Open Data Entre os valores que orientam a atividade e a cultura do Munic\u00edpio do Porto destacam-se a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o para o cidad\u00e3o, a melhoria cont\u00ednua e a inova\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste \u00e2mbito, e tendo muito presente a crescente import\u00e2ncia assumida pelos dados, da informa\u00e7\u00e3o e do conhecimento que a partir deles pode ser gerado, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto pretende responder ao desafio do atual paradigma de dados abertos. Portal de Dados Abertos do Munic\u00edpio do Porto Com o intuito de gerar valor atrav\u00e9s da disponibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o que pode ser utilizada e combinada de forma a gerar conhecimento pelos mais diversificados agentes da cidade, o Munic\u00edpio do Porto vai implementar um Portal de Dados Abertos. Assim sendo, pretende-se que o Portal seja n\u00e3o s\u00f3 um reposit\u00f3rio de dados, mas igualmente um interface colaborativo e de participa\u00e7\u00e3o ativa entre o Munic\u00edpio, os cidad\u00e3os, as empresas, a Academia, as institui\u00e7\u00f5es e demais organiza\u00e7\u00f5es e entidades das mais diversas \u00e1reas de interven\u00e7\u00e3o, numa estrat\u00e9gia de governa\u00e7\u00e3o mais transparente e participativa, por parte da cidade. Estes dados, muitos deles georreferenciados, s\u00e3o extremamente \u00fateis, constituindo um suporte \u00e0 atividade municipal, uma ferramenta de apoio \u00e0 tomada de decis\u00e3o, \u00e0 delinea\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas e estrat\u00e9gias bem informadas e suportadas, em conson\u00e2ncia com o objetivo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de cidades inteligentes, inclusivas e sustent\u00e1veis, plasmado na Estrat\u00e9gia Europa 2020. \u00c2mbito e objetivos deste documento estrat\u00e9gico Com este documento pretende-se sistematizar os princ\u00edpios orientadores a montante da cria\u00e7\u00e3o do Portal de Dados Abertos do Munic\u00edpio do Porto, contextualizando-os no atual paradigma de disponibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados aos cidad\u00e3os, \u00e0 Academia, empresas e demais entidades como forma de potenciar a transpar\u00eancia governativa e melhorar a participa\u00e7\u00e3o dos agentes no processo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimento sobre a cidade. 1) A pol\u00edtica de dados abertos A informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma necessidade para qualquer setor da atividade humana.

Open Data is a philosophy and practice that aims to make certain data freely available to everyone, without copyright restrictions, patents, or other control mechanisms. The data should be published in raw (unprocessed) form, well-structured, and in known formats that facilitate reuse. The public sector produces a wide variety of information of interest to citizens and businesses, such as social, economic, geographic, statistical, meteorological, or tourist information, as well as information about companies and education. This information has characteristics that make it particularly attractive to the digital content sector, as it is complete, reliable, and of high quality. Opening up public sector data allows any person or organization to build a new idea upon it, resulting in new data, knowledge, improved processes, added value to existing ones, or even the creation of new services. Therefore, it has considerable economic potential and also promotes transparency, participation, and citizen collaboration, which are necessary for a more open government. WHY? Transparency. The reliability and origin of the data make it an excellent means of communicating public management, accountability, and external control of management, all aimed at being transparent in the management of public service and generating trust in the population. Reuse of public information. Any organization generates vast amounts of information useful to other departments or organizations. Open Data is established as a tool for publishing and reusing information in which administrations make their work available to citizens for them to reuse. Generation and incentivization of economies. The generation of economies from open data has multiple facets, such as efficiency in management, savings due to the reuse of information eliminating duplicate expenses, efficiencies associated with greater visibility of processes and the possibility of establishing improvement actions on them, creation of new services, allowing the establishment of internal or external collaboration mechanisms, allowing mechanisms for generating low-cost services, establishing data commercialization models, etc. Source of innovation. The availability of new data sources leads to innovation, allowing the strengthening of business lines, the creation of new services, approaching problems from other perspectives, collaboration in the face of challenges, etc. FOR WHOM? For Developers: Fostering the reuse of public information, enabling the creation of new services, promoting innovation, reducing the investments necessary for application development, and generally providing reliable information on which to develop research and business. For Citizens: Valuing the result of public management in a transparent, consistent, and reliable manner. For the Administration: Reducing barriers to the reuse of information, eliminating redundancies, promoting efficiency in management, and hindering undesirable situations such as corruption or embezzlement of public funds. All datasets offered by the Diputaci\u00f3n de C\u00e1diz, unless otherwise indicated, are published under the terms of the license for the Reuse of Public Sector Information for the scope of the State Public Sector.\n\n*Translated from Spanish*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nDATOS ABIERTOS PUERTOLLANO Datos abiertos (Open Data en ingl\u00e9s) es una filosof\u00eda y pr\u00e1ctica que persigue que determinados datos est\u00e9n disponibles de forma libre a todo el mundo, sin restricciones de copyright, patentes u otros mecanismos de control. Los datos deben publicarse en bruto (sin procesar), bien estructurados y en formatos conocidos que faciliten la reutilizaci\u00f3n. El sector p\u00fablico produce una gran variedad de informaci\u00f3n interesante para los ciudadanos y empresas, como por ejemplo, informaci\u00f3n social, econ\u00f3mica, geogr\u00e1fica, estad\u00edstica, meteorol\u00f3gica o tur\u00edstica y sobre empresas y educaci\u00f3n.

Measuring the health status of the population is a tradition in public health.

With advances in the control of infectious diseases (Epidemiological and Morbidity Information) and with a better understanding of the concept of health and its population determinants, the analysis of the health situation began to incorporate other dimensions of health status. Data on morbidity, disability, access to services, quality of care, living conditions, and environmental factors became metrics used in the construction of Health Indicators, which translate into relevant information for the quantification and evaluation of health information.

It provides access and integration of a range of datasets published by a variety of local organisations and community groups. Most datasets are open and freely available for search, download in open-source formats and reuse as a community service. By bringing together datasets focused on Ballarat and facilitating exchanges across different organisations and group,s this project aims to foster new forms of digital innovation, collaboration and business and research opportunities.\n\nOn this platform you can search a wide range of datasets by theme, keyword and organisation. Most datasets are available for download within the platform in a variety of common open-source formats including a CKAN API for developers. It is a core principle of this project that data and data ownership is retained by the original creators/custodians therefore some datasets with more sensitive content may have access control specified by the data providers with contact information.\n\nIn addition to data access and searches, Ballarat Open Data provides a number of information dashboards, interactive portals and data stories using the available open datasets. This includes dynamic and live data feeds of smart devices and sensors from the new LoraWAN network installed throughout the City as part of the broader Ballarat Smart Cities and Suburb. These applications are provided as a resource for key use-cases of community interest and a showcase of the potential of open data.

In 1962 in Muaklek District, Saraburi Province to promote and support dairy farming activities of farmers in Thailand.\n\nIt is generally known that each producer needs to have good dairy cattle that can produce consistently good yields and are easy to raise. It is suitable for the parenting system of Thai farmers and can pass on those virtues to their children. For this reason, \"selection\" Dairy cows with genetic abilities for economically important characteristics, suitable and precise, therefore play an important role, no less. \"Mating pairing\" so that the calf generation has better genetic production potential than the parent generation. \"Providing information and advice on the selection and breeding of dairy breeders with characteristics that are suitable for the parenting system of each Thai farmer\" is one of the important missions that the OA We will try to implement thoroughly, comprehensively, and continuously so that all farmers can develop the potential of dairy production in their own production system better and with low production costs.\n\nThe evaluation of the achievement of different forms of dairy breeding of the OECD was first conducted in 1974 by Dr. Knud Vinther, a Danish expert, and a working group of the OECD. The data obtained from that operation was mostly used to formulate policies and breeding plans of government agencies. Therefore, the dissemination of genetic characteristics of breeders at the farmer level for use in breed selection is minimal. After that, the It is trying to develop a system for storing milk production data of dairy cows that are the daughters of various breeders that are produced continuously. It is hoped that the information will be useful for both dairy farmers in Thailand and the development of various activities of the OECD itself.\n\nLater, in 1995, the Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sorathep Thamwasorn received the cooperation of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sorathep Thamwasorn. Associate Professor of the Department of Veterinary Medicine Faculty of Agriculture, Kasetsart University (Bangkok), who is the head of the research and breeding project for beef and dairy cattle in the tropics of the Research and Development Institute of Kasetsart University. In providing knowledge and advice on statistical data analysis for dairy cattle breeding by the \"Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP)\" method, which is the most accurate and highly unbiased estimation method. to the working group of the OECD using the existing database and with the control of practical operations and continuous supervision of the Deputy Director. (Mr. Noppakun Suanprasert) and the Head of the Cattle Breeding Office (Mr. Kaset Wittayanuphat Yongyong) at that time. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture and Kasetsart University was able to prepare the first book \"D.P.O. Sire and Dam Summary\" in 1996 to be disseminated to farmers to use in the selection of breeding dairy cows. For increasing production potential within their own production system. The book was the first (individual) dairy genetic talent document in Southeast Asia and was published annually until 1999.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, the preparation of the dairy breeding fee book had to be temporarily stopped due to various problems that occurred within the agency. Restructuring and coordination of cooperation in data analysis with Kasetsart University. However, during that time, The Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture continues to carry out activities to collect data on the yield and quality of raw milk produced from dairy cows raised by farmers under the supervision and promotion of the and collect that information in the database system of the SEC. continuously\n\nLater, in 2002, the Dairy Breeding Fee Book of the Dairy Cattle Breeding Authority was re-prepared again.

Kasetsart University and University of Florida (USA) Statistical tactics used to analyze data and verify the accuracy and connectedness of data are continuously developed in the form of research.

This is a data catalog that follows the principles of open data publication, which must be: Likewise, the best practices of FAIR data indicate that these should be: In this way, the aim is to generate added value in the work and research of students, researchers, and professional members of the university community. Open data is data that is free to use without restrictions. Governments and their agencies, universities and their researchers, non-governmental organizations and their donors, and even corporations, are potential sources of open data. Data, as a public rather than a private resource, embedded in the principles of universal access, participation, and transparency, is promoted as capable of restoring deteriorated levels of trust between citizens and institutions. The transformative potential of open data lies not only in its value as an educational resource and as an engine for the development of Open Science initiatives, but also as a tool to activate the university community in active and democratic participation towards the improvement of higher education as a whole, through innovation and accountability. According to Belbis and Atenas (ILDA, 2017), there are three converging paths for working with open data in higher education: for its contribution to educational development, for its scientific value, and for its contribution to transparency and accountability. The first two points are what we believe are most important for adopting the opening of research data in the academic environment. On the one hand, open data allows students to learn to solve real problems, develop knowledge, and engage with participatory research. It allows them to come into contact with new content formats and learn to use data analysis, visualization, and processing tools. On the other hand, open data is the heart of Open Science, since it facilitates not only scientific research, but also promotes its transparency, allowing research to be reproduced, as well as crossing raw data and combining it with others, expanding the limits of knowledge development in diverse fields. Therefore, adopting the use and production of open data in the City Observatory of FASTA University provides benefits such as innovating at the pedagogical level, developing transversal skills in students, expanding the impact of research since the data can be considered citable materials. In addition, access to open research data can improve the quality and efficiency in science.\n\n*Translated from Spanish*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nEn este portal se encuentran publicados los resultados de distintos trabajos desarrollados por el Observatorio Universitario de la Ciudad. Se trata de un cat\u00e1logo de datos que sigue los principios de publicaci\u00f3n de los datos abiertos, los cuales deben ser: Asimismo, las buenas pr\u00e1cticas de los datos FAIR indican que estos deben ser: De esta manera se busca generar valor agregado en los trabajos e investigaciones de estudiantes, investigadores y profesionales miembros de la comunidad universitaria. Los datos abiertos son datos de uso gratuito sin restricciones. Los gobiernos y sus agencias, las universidades y sus investigadores, las organizaciones no gubernamentales y sus donantes, e incluso las corporaciones, son fuentes potenciales de datos abiertos. Los datos, como un recurso p\u00fablico en lugar de privado, incrustados en los principios de acceso universal, participaci\u00f3n y transparencia, se promocionan como capaces de restaurar los niveles deteriorados de confianza entre los ciudadanos y las instituciones. El potencial transformador de los datos abiertos no reside s\u00f3lo en su valor como recurso educativo y como motor para el desarrollo de iniciativas de Ciencia Abierta, sino como una herramienta para activar la comunidad universitaria en una participaci\u00f3n activa y democr\u00e1tica hacia la mejora de la educaci\u00f3n superior en su conjunto, a trav\u00e9s de la innovaci\u00f3n y la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas. Seg\u00fan Belbis y Atenas (ILDA, 2017), hay tres caminos confluyentes por donde trabajar con datos abiertos en la educaci\u00f3n superior: por su aporte al desarrollo educativo, por su valor cient\u00edfico y por su aporte a la transparencia y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas. Los dos primeros puntos son los que creemos m\u00e1s importantes para adoptar la apertura de datos de investigaciones en el entorno acad\u00e9mico. Por un lado, los datos abiertos permiten a los estudiantes aprender a resolver problemas reales, desarrollar conocimiento y vincularse con la investigaci\u00f3n participativa. Les permite entrar en contacto con nuevos formatos de contenidos y aprender a manejar herramientas de an\u00e1lisis, visualizaci\u00f3n y procesamiento de datos. Por otro lado, los datos abiertos son el coraz\u00f3n de la Ciencia Abierta, ya que facilitan no s\u00f3lo la investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica, sino que promueven su transparencia, permitiendo reproducir investigaciones, as\u00ed como cruzar datos crudos y combinarlos con otros, expandiendo los l\u00edmites del desarrollo de conocimiento en campos diversos.

In order to be able to combine data and services from different Member States, data must be harmonised. The common data models, code lists, map layers and metadata to be used in the exchange of spatial data are set out in the Interoperability Regulation and the Technical Guidelines.\n\nThe INSPIRE Information System for Public Services and Public Administration Services (ISSI) provides data falling under the topic 6 of Annex III to Act No. 123/1998 Coll. The system will gradually include spatial datasets on rescue services, public administration offices, environmental protection offices, fire services, cemeteries, social services, education services, public order, healthcare, environmental management facilities and the required data on technical infrastructure including common collector lines, electricity networks, oil pipelines, gas pipelines and other chemical distribution networks, sewage networks and water supply networks.\n\n*Translated from Czech*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\nInforma\u010dn\u00ed syst\u00e9m pro ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 slu\u017eby a slu\u017eby ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vy INSPIRE (ISSI)\nCo to je sm\u011brnice INSPIRE?\nSm\u011brnice INSPIRE vytv\u00e1\u0159\u00ed legislativn\u00ed r\u00e1mec pot\u0159ebn\u00fd k vybudov\u00e1n\u00ed evropsk\u00e9 infrastruktury pro prostorov\u00e9 informace INSPIRE a z\u00e1klad pro koordina\u010dn\u00ed mechanismus pot\u0159ebn\u00fd k jej\u00edmu fungov\u00e1n\u00ed na evropsk\u00e9 \u00farovni - stanovuje obecn\u00e1 pravidla pro jej\u00ed zalo\u017een\u00ed, spr\u00e1vu a vyu\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed zejm\u00e9na k podpo\u0159e environment\u00e1ln\u00edch politik a politik, kter\u00e9 \u017eivotn\u00ed prost\u0159ed\u00ed ovliv\u0148uj\u00ed.\n\nHlavn\u00edm c\u00edlem INSPIRE je poskytnout kvalitn\u00ed a standardizovan\u00e9 prostorov\u00e9 informace pro vytv\u00e1\u0159en\u00ed a uplat\u0148ov\u00e1n\u00ed politik Spole\u010denstv\u00ed na v\u0161ech \u00farovn\u00edch \u010dlensk\u00fdch st\u00e1t\u016f.

The repository aims to address the critical need for the secure storage and publication of research data from the Greek scientific community, to increase transparency in research, to enable reuse by interested researchers worldwide, to accelerate the digital transformation of the research field in our country, and to adopt competitive practices in research proposals and scientific communication. All researchers from Greek Universities are connected to the repository with their credentials and can easily upload their research data. Special teams of editors, either within an academic unit (e.g., laboratory head) or at an institutional level (e.g., Library staff), can make your data public, which will have permanent identifiers, the ability to link to your unique ORCiD identifier, and coupling with your published work, e.g., with a scientific journal article. For special cases, access can be controlled and provided upon request. HARDMIN has been developed with the open-source software CKAN and, together with HELIX, constitutes the national digital scientific infrastructure (eInfrastructure) software for providing catalog and repository services for scientific data, part of the infrastructure network for Open Science. The repository will have the ability to connect to existing repositories and retrieve the corresponding data from already existing collections. The repository is accessible at https://hardmin.heal-link.gr, and interested researchers can contact their local Library for more details. Currently, the repository is operating on a pilot basis to resolve technical details.\n\n*Translated from Greek*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**\n\u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2

Working in collaboration with partners in industry and academia, H-Mat R&D focuses on the effects of hydrogen on performance of polymers and metals used in hydrogen infrastructure and storage. H-Mat's ultimate goals are to improve the reliability of materials, reduce the costs of materials, and inform codes and standards that guide development and use of hydrogen technologies. H-Mat was launched in 2018 by the U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies Office within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in support of the H2@Scale initiative.

The \"Hong Kong Public Policy Data Repository\" (\u6c11\u9593\u653f\u7b56\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab) began its planning and establishment in 2018, with the hope of providing a platform in the era of big data. This platform aims to allow groups in civil society focusing on different policy areas to simultaneously organize and classify the data/information they collect while researching their respective policies. This will make it easier for others interested in these policies to find relevant data/information in the future, enabling civil society to accumulate the results of policy research. Currently, the \"Hong Kong Public Policy Data Repository\" is maintained by members of working groups and organizations in various policy areas who voluntarily organize the various datasets. Any organization interested in participating and contributing data/information is welcome to contact the \"Civil Society Long-Term Development Movement\" (see email address below). The \"Hong Kong Public Policy Data Repository\" is a channel for open data, aimed at promoting information openness and exchange. All data is for non-commercial use only.

Since then, the effort to strengthen Danish language technology has also been included in more recent political agreements, most recently in the Government's strategic effort for artificial intelligence from 2024.\n\nThe political anchoring of sprogteknologi.dk is in the 'Steering Group for Digital Innovation and Green Transition', which consists of a number of government authorities, the Danish Local Government and the Danish Regions. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation  is the secretariat for sprogteknologi.dk. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation's ambition is that solutions involving artificial intelligence should function just as well in a Danish context as in the context of the major languages. In this context, the Agency considers Danish language data to be a strategic resource that is necessary to ensure that artificial intelligence can be used in Denmark right now and in the future. Therefore, the Agency focuses on the work with language resources and not on the actual development of new language technology solutions or language models. \n\nThe majority of language technology developed today is based on major languages, such as English, Chinese, Spanish, German and French, which is why language technology often lacks understanding and knowledge of the Danish language and Danish culture. Language technology is based on data that represents linguistic characteristics, cultural norms and values \u200b\u200band therefore has an impact on how the technology interprets input and how it responds.

We believe that transparency creates trust and promotes data-driven innovation. As part of this policy, we are pleased to make available to the general public an open data portal, which includes diverse databases about the city of Kfar Saba and the municipality's activities. Currently, the site includes diverse databases from areas of the resident's life; transportation, education, housing, infrastructure, security, welfare, environment, business, etc., which are received from the municipality, government ministries, various corporations, and more. We believe that this project will bring many benefits to the advancement of the municipality and the city by achieving three central goals: 1. Increasing trust and partnership between the city's residents and the municipality. 2. Encouraging cooperation between the municipality and private entrepreneurs and promoting independent digital initiatives. 3. Streamlining the processes of obtaining information from the municipality in specific requests for information. The portal contains municipal databases in open source format, using leading technology (open source Ckan infrastructure). Ckan is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible to everyone by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, searching, and usage in order to enable the broadest possible use of information. The information on the portal is accessible in various formats as detailed below: 1. XLS \u2013 A format based on an electronic data sheet that allows performing mathematical operations. 2. AutoCAD software formats \u2013 AutoCAD is a professional software for 2D and 3D design and drafting, used to create models of parts and other drawings for use in the manufacturing industry. The software generates several data formats that can be made accessible, including: Shx, SHP. 3. XML \u2013 A markup language for documents containing structured information. XML is platform-independent and allows any computer program to use it, regardless of the type of hardware or operating system; the data can be processed. 4. Formats from GIS systems \u2013 including files of the type: cpj, Geo XML, GeoJSON. 5. JSON \u2013 (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-readable, textual format intended for transferring information structures composed of key-value pairs. The main use of the format is for transferring information between a server and a consumer as a replacement for the XML format. 6. CSV \u2013 A way to store tables in plain text.

Since 2018, NUM has been actively developing its own open data and is making various data from official sources available to the public through this portal. This initiative is the first of its kind in Mongolia, and it is a good example and a pioneer in showing the data about its activities openly.\n\nOpen data is \u201celectronic data that anyone can freely use, reuse, and redistribute, usually with attribution and under the same terms and conditions.\u201d The development of open data at the national level is important for supporting innovation, ensuring economic growth, creating new jobs, increasing citizen participation in government activities, improving public-private partnerships, making public services faster, more transparent, and more accessible, and increasing efficiency.\n\nThe development of open data at the MNU level will OPEN UP many NEW OPPORTUNITIES, including new products and services (electronic or otherwise) using MNU data, supporting data-driven decision-making, objectively identifying the problems facing the school, improving partnerships with the school (with other universities, government agencies, business and the private sector, etc.).\n\nHow is the data published?\nMost of the data published on this portal is published directly (automatically) from the information systems used at MNU at a certain frequency. Each data component has a certain frequency of update. For example, the names of teaching staff are approved by the order of the director at the beginning of the new academic year, as is the course schedule. Such data will be updated once a semester.\n\nIn some cases, the path to the HTML and PDF data published on the official website of the National University of Mongolia num.edu.mn (or others, but with the *.num.edu.mn domain) is indicated.\n\nData elements and data\nData refers to a collection of text or numeric values \u200b\u200bthat represent any event or fact, with a specific structure. For example, a single-line data may be a document that shows the position and structural unit of a teacher/employee at the National University of Mongolia, such as name, position, contact address, and work address. These single-line data are collected and combined to create data. HTML and PDF are also considered data because they are collections of text.

This Bavaria-wide catalog service is a central component of the SDDI ecosystem (Link). It serves as a point of contact for all local/regional catalog services of the 6 SDDI model regions (Ha\u00dffurt, Garching, Grafing, LK Wunsiedel, LK Neustadt a.d. Waldnaab, LK Freyung-Grafenau) currently under development, as well as for other interested regions. Region-spanning services, Apps, APIs, and other information related to the operation of an SDDI are bundled here. The ZD.B Smart Cities and Regions Thematic Platform operates this catalog service jointly with the Chair of Geoinformatics at the Technical University of Munich.\n\nSDDI Ecosystem. The SDDI ecosystem consists of four interlocking components: (1) Guideline, (2) Software, (3) Organization, (4) Community. In 2020, an SDDI guideline will be developed by the Chair of Geoinformatics at the Technical University of Munich. The guideline is intended to provide all stakeholders interested in implementing an open regional data infrastructure with free, low-threshold technical and organizational support. For the simple technical implementation of the SDDI infrastructure, we consistently work with existing open-source software. This means that we use the CKAN catalog software for the systematic presentation of datasets from a wide variety of data owners. The Masterportal, which is now used in numerous German regional authorities, serves for the simple geobased visualization of the datasets. To ensure that the ecosystem can also be operated sustainably, we are developing a suitable business model in parallel with the technical implementation of the SDDI ecosystem. A data cooperative for data owners, which is yet to be founded, is to ensure the further development and implementation of the catalog service operation from 2021. Specifically, this data cooperative will provide professional services for data use, refinement, and, above all, cross-sectoral use for its members and beyond. Furthermore, the existing SDDI know-how should be professionally conveyed to interested regions and stakeholders within the framework of an SDDI hub. Together with interested stakeholders from the model regions as well as the involved scientific institutions and community members from the CKAN & Masterportal scene, an SDDI community is to be established, which will drive the further development of the SDDI ecosystem.\n\nStructuring of the Datasets. The assignment of the datasets into groups, as well as the number and division of the groups themselves, is the result of long and intensive consideration. The division into three main groups enables a simple search for datasets and an easily understandable assignment to specific subject areas. Links between individual datasets are possible through a special extension and facilitate navigation.\n\nSmart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI). The catalog platform is part of the SDDI concept, which is used for data structuring in the field of Smart Cities and Regions. The idea of the SDDI emerged in the course of the Europe-wide Smart Sustainable Districts project at the Chair of Geoinformatics at the TUM, and is also the result of very long and extensive considerations. At the heart of the SDDI is the catalog platform, which manages the metadata of the individual datasets and provides an overview of the total inventory of all available data.\n\nTechnical Implementation. The technical implementation of the catalog platform is based on the open-source software CKAN http://ckan.org/. For some of the functionalities, extensions are used, which on the one hand come from the official CKAN extension library, and on the other hand were developed at the Chair of Geoinformatics at the TUM. The catalog platform is operated in the backend via a PostgreSQL database http://postgresql.org/, which also enables the storage and processing of spatial data.\n\nImprint.

Er ist Anlaufstelle f\u00fcr alle bisher im Aufbau befindlichen lokalen/regionalen Katalogdienste der 6 SDDI-Modellregionen (Ha\u00dffurt, Garching, Grafing, LK Wunsiedel, LK Neustadt a.d. Waldnaab, LK Freyung-Grafenau) sowie f\u00fcr andere interessierte Regionen. Hier werden vor allem Regionen-\u00fcbergreifende Dienste, APP\u00b4s,, API\u00b4s und sonstige Informationen zum Betrieb einer SDDI geb\u00fcndelt. Die ZD.B-Themenplattform Smart Cities and Regions betreibt diesen Katalogdienst gemeinsam mit dem Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Geoinformatik der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen. SDDI-\u00d6kosystem Das SDDI-\u00d6kosystem besteht aus vier ineinandergreifenden Bausteinen. (1) Leitfaden, (2) Software, (3) Organisation, (4) Community. In 2020 wird ein SDDI-Leitfaden vom Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Geoininformatik der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen entwickelt. Der Leitfaden soll f\u00fcr alle an der Einf\u00fchrung einer offenen regionalen Dateninfrastruktur interessierten Akteure eine kostenlose, niedrigschwellige technisch-organisatorische Hilfestellung bereitstellen. Zur einfachen technischen Realisierung der SDDI-Infrastruktur arbeiten wir durchg\u00e4ngig mit vorhandener Open-Source Software. D.h. zur systematischen Darstellung der Datens\u00e4tze unterschiedlichster Dateneigner nutzen wir die Katalog-Software CKAN. Zur einfachen geobasierten Visualisierung der Datens\u00e4tze dient das mittlerweile in zahlreichen deutschen Gebietsk\u00f6rperschaften eingesetzten Masterportal. Damit das \u00d6ko-System auch nachhaltig betrieben werden kann entwickeln wir, parallel zur technisch inhaltlichen Realisierung des SDDI-\u00d6ko-Systems, auch ein geeignetes Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell. Eine noch zu gr\u00fcndende Datengenossenschaft f\u00fcr Dateneigner soll ab 2021 die Weiterentwicklung und Umsetzung des Katalogdienstbetriebes sicherstellen. Konkret soll diese Datengenossenschaft professionelle Services f\u00fcr die Datennutzung, Veredelung und vor allem eine sektor\u00fcbergreifende Nutzung f\u00fcr seine Mitglieder und dar\u00fcber hinaus bereitstellen. Ferner soll f\u00fcr interessierte Regionen und Akteure das vorhandene SDDI-Know-How im Rahmen eines SDDI-Hubs professionell vermittelt werden k\u00f6nnen. Gemeinsam mit interessierten Akteuren aus den Modellregionen sowie den involvierten wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen und Community-Mitgliedern aus der CKAN & Masterportal-Szene soll eine SDDI-Community aufgebaut werden, welche die Weiterentwicklung des SDDI-\u00d6ko-Systems vorantreibt. Strukturierung der Datens\u00e4tze Die Zuordnung der Datens\u00e4tze in Gruppen, sowie die Anzahl und Aufteilung der Gruppen selbst, istdas Ergebnis von langer und intensiver \u00dcberlegungen. Durch die Unterteilung in drei Hauptgruppen wird eine einfache Suche von Datens\u00e4tzen, sowie eine leicht rsichtliche Zuordnung zu besimmten Themenbereichen erm\u00f6glicht. Verkn\u00fcpfungen zwischen einzelnen Datens\u00e4tzen sind durch eine spezielle Erweiterung m\u00f6glich und erleichtern die Navigation. Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) Die Katalogplattform ist Teil des SDDI-Konzepts, das f\u00fcr die Datenstrukturierung im Bereich der Smarten St\u00e4dte und Regionen angewendet wird. Die Idee der SDDI ist im Zuge des europaweiten Smart Sustainable Districts Projektes am Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Geoinformatik an der TUM entstanden, und ist ebenfalls das Ergebnis von sehr langen und ausgiebigen \u00dcberlegungen. Im Mittelpunkt der SDDI steht de Katalogplattform, welche die Metadaten der einzelnen Datens\u00e4tze verwaltet und eine \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber den Gesamtbestand aller Verf\u00fcgbaren Daten liefert.

F\u00fcr einige der Funktionalit\u00e4ten werden Erweiterungen eingesetzt, welche zum einne Teil aus der offiziellen CKAN-Erweiterungsbibliothek stammen, und zum anderen Teil am Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Geoinformatik der TUM entwickelt wurden. Die Katalogplattform wird im Backend \u00fcber eine PostgreSQL Datenbank http://postgresql.org/ betrieben, weche auch die Speicherung und Verarbeitung von raumbezogenen Daten erm\u00f6glicht.

INTAROS has a strong focus on contributing to the in-situ observing system and carries out fieldwork activities in coordination with national and international initiatives. The fieldwork will take place in different regions of the Arctic both on land and in ocean. Partners also compile, quality control and make available datasets collected by earlier campaigns, to provide access to datasets previously only available in closed communities and to extend time series of key ocean and climate parameters such as sea ice concentration, thickness and displacement. The INTAROS Data Catalogue contains descriptions of data collected or compiled by partners during the project, or where INTAROS partners have contributed to data acquisition or publication. INTAROS conducts a series of field experiments in different regions of the Arctic, and collects a suite of parameters for different themes: INTAROS partners also exploits data from various satellite missions, to generate long time series of key ocean and climate variables for the Arctic Region. For both collected and compiled datasets, this catalogue provides general information such as location, time, parameters contained, contact person and license. A link to the dataset itself is also provided, when the provider has made it available online. The catalogue will grow as the project progresses and partners prepare more datasets and make them available for sharing with other with other scientists and stakeholders.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.50887, 37.64292]}, "properties": {"id": "ad09df87-0616-490d-8efc-c7df88c375f8", "name": "hungarian-open-data-catalog", "title": "Hungarian Open Data Catalog", "url": "https://opendata.hu", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/hungarian-open-data-catalog", "state": "active", "description": "Opendata.hu is a free and public Hungarian data catalog. The site was created by volunteers and civil organizations with the aim of creating the first Hungarian website collecting open data and databases. Public and public-interest data not subject to copyright protection can be freely uploaded and organized on the site. Until the official establishment of the Hungarian OpenData Foundation/Association, opendata.hu is operated by K-Monitor Public Benefit Association (K-Monitor) with the help of enthusiastic volunteers, and the operation is carried out by Precognox. In the longer term, the site also aims to be a meeting place for citizens, IT professionals, and researchers interested in open data, where background materials and forums on the topic are available to users. The sources of the materials collected on the site can be open datasets produced by Hungarian public administration bodies, scientific and cultural institutions, and economic associations, as well as data created by citizens. Opendata.hu does not aim to be a competitor to state databases (e.g., kozadat.hu), but rather to complement them, as a volunteer-based, non-governmental, and non-profit online community. We welcome everyone who would like to contribute to the expansion and operation of the site with their data and work, and of course also those who would support the strengthening of the Hungarian opendata community with their donations. Register and upload your data, or send it to info@opendata.hu. Write to us if you would like to participate in the work of the open data community in any way.

The Catalog inventories all IOOS Data Management (DMAC)-compliant data access service endpoints provided by these entities in a single metadata repository, for discovery by end users. The Catalog is populated by ISO 19115 metadata records that describe the observations taken and forecast model outputs produced by the RAs and DACs using DMAC-recommended standard vocabularies and data formats wherever possible (netCDF-CF [1], ACDD [2]). The RAs and DACs publish their metadata to web accessible folders, or OGC CS-W services, and the Catalog harvests metadata from these locations on a daily basis. Because IOOS data provider metadata is often produced in an automated fashion by software reading native data file attributes (such as CF attribution in a netCDF file, for example), a daily automated harvest of the ISO XML metadata is necessary, in order to keep frequently varying information such as dataset time coverage current. The Catalog provides a searchable user graphical user interface (https://data.ioos.us/) for interactive data discovery by users, as well as a native API (https://data.ioos.us/api/3) and OGC CS-W (https://data.ioos.us/csw?service=CSW&request=GetCapabilities) -compatible service for machine-based access to its inventory of data products. Downstream national IOOS products such as the IOOS Environmental Sensor Map (https://sensors.ioos.us) use the Catalog inventory for real-time sensor observation services to include in its map portal. The IOOS Catalog is made up of three main components: the Data Catalog (the public user interface, based on CKAN open data catalog software) the Harvest Registry (an internal site used by data providers to manage metadata harvest sources) the Service Monitor (service uptime monitoring) Additional information about the IOOS Catalog and components, including instructions for IOOS data providers, can be found here: https://ioos.github.io/catalog. Catalog GitHub Repository: https://github.com/ioos/catalog. For information on project development timelines, Catalog source code, or to file an issue, please see the GitHub repo. The current faceted filtering options provided by the CKAN software underlying the Data Catalog are: Location (i.e. geographic bounding box), Organization (e.g. PacIOOS, GLOS, etc) Tags/keywords (e.g. sea_water_temperature, sea_water_electrical_conductivity) Formats (e.g. HTML, SOS, OPeNDAP, etc). Date and time Data providers There is also the option to do a free text search, which will search indexed metadata fields such as dataset title, abstract, keywords, and others and provide matched datasets. The datasets search page provides an option to search by start and/or end time. The CS-W service is provided by pycsw, a Python-based OGC Catalog Service software. It has its own internal search implementation that sometimes gives different results than CKAN\u2019s embedded search, which is powered by the Apache Solr search indexing software. There is a long-term plan to abstract pycsw\u2019s search implementation to allow external pluggable search implementations (including Solr) to interoperate with pycsw but this functionality is not yet available. Partially. The CI_RoleCode in ISO 19115 with a value of \"originator\" is used as the value of the data provider field. With development of standardized metadata profiles to represent this information in incoming metadata from the IOOS RAs and DACs, the CKAN catalog software could be extended to provide richer filtering options including concepts such as RA or platform operator. For more information on planned work on this, see: https://github.com/ioos/catalog/milestone/7. At the moment, there is not a straightforward technique for this. We hope to address this deficiency in the near future. As part of an upcoming development milestone (https://github.com/ioos/catalog/milestone/7), we will be investigating enhancements to both the CKAN software as well as developing metadata conventions to better enable our data providers to tag oceanographic forecast model output in a distinctive way that could then be represented in the Data Catalog interface to users. Also, the ability to filter data by time coverage should complement a forecast model tagging capability to search for data covering present time onward. Yes. Under the hood, CKAN uses Solr for search, and can accept Solr query strings in either the dataset search on the website or the package_search CKAN API endpoint. CF Standard Names are primarily provided by the `cf_standard_names` field. An example query is below: https://data.ioos.us/dataset?q=cf_standard_names:\"sea_water_pressure\" GCMD keywords work somewhat differently and are organized by hierarchy For example a query of https://data.ioos.us/dataset?q=gcmd_keywords:\"Earth Science > Oceans > Ocean Chemistry > Chlorophyll\" is equivalent to specifying the following values for gcmd_keywords: \"EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN CHEMISTRY > CHLOROPHYLL\" \"Earth Science>Oceans>Ocean Chemistry>Chlorophyll\" \"Earth Science > Oceans > Ocean Chemistry > Chlorophyll\" The search is hierarchical and can also contain prefixes, i.e. https://data.ioos.us/dataset?q=gcmd_keywords:\"Earth Science > Oceans\" will find any GCMD keywords underneath it. If you want to search for a suffix with GCMD keywords, you will need to use a wildcard search: *Water\\ Temperature' Note here the use of the escaped space per the Lucene query syntax. An example request to the CKAN API to query both GCMD Keywords starting with a value of \"EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN SCIENCE\" and a CF standard name of \"sea_water_electrical_conductivity\" using cURL is below curl 'https://data.ioos.us/api/3/action/package_search?fq=gcmd_keywords:\"EARTH+SCIENCE+>+OCEANS+>+OCEAN+TEMPERATURE\"+cf_standard_names:\"sea_water_electrical_conductivity\"' An example request to the CKAN API to query both GCMD Keywords starting with a value of \"EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN SCIENCE\" and a CF standard name of \"sea_water_electrical_conductivity\" using cURL is below References: [1].

The political basis for sprogteknologi.dk can be found in the previous National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence from 2019, the Digitization Pact and the Economic Agreements for 2020 between the Government, KL  and Danish Regions , in which the establishment of a joint Danish language resource was adopted. Since then, the effort to strengthen Danish language technology has also been included in more recent political agreements, most recently in the Government's strategic effort for artificial intelligence from 2024.\n\nThe political anchoring of sprogteknologi.dk is in the 'Steering Group for Digital Innovation and Green Transition', which consists of a number of government authorities, the Danish Local Government and the Danish Regions. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation  is the secretariat for sprogteknologi.dk.The Danish Agency for Digitalisation's ambition is that solutions involving artificial intelligence should function just as well in a Danish context as in the context of the major languages. In this context, the Agency considers Danish language data to be a strategic resource that is necessary to ensure that artificial intelligence can be used in Denmark right now and in the future. Therefore, the Agency focuses on the work with language resources and not on the actual development of new language technology solutions or language models. \n\nThe majority of language technology developed today is based on major languages, such as English, Chinese, Spanish, German and French, which is why language technology often lacks understanding and knowledge of the Danish language and Danish culture. Language technology is based on data that represents linguistic characteristics, cultural norms and values \u200b\u200band therefore has an impact on how the technology interprets input and how it responds. Lack of available Danish language resources makes it difficult or ineffective to use new technology in a Danish context.\n\n ", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [131.294542, 32.097681]}, "properties": {"id": "8e949e54-3fa3-4fe6-977d-13168565d966", "name": "miyazaki-prefecture-statistics-data-catalog", "title": "Miyazaki Prefecture Statistics Data Catalog (\u307f\u3084\u3056\u304d\u7d71\u8a08BOX\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0)", "url": "https://data.stat.pref.miyazaki.lg.jp", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/miyazaki-prefecture-statistics-data-catalog", "state": "active", "description": "The Miyazaki Statistics BOX Data Catalog is a website that widely publishes statistical information held by Miyazaki Prefecture as open data.

"CIOOS\nThe Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) [sea-use] is a national online platform to make ocean data openly discoverable and accessible, and to facilitate knowledge exchange in ocean sciences. Ocean observations produced through regional systems and networks are key to effective ocean management. Three regional associations (RAs) located in the Pacific, the St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic work closely with local oceanographic communities to meet their needs for using CIOOS.\n\nCIOOS Pacific\nThrough meaningful engagement and ongoing communication, CIOOS Pacific staff are developing a data management system that focuses on Canada\u2019s West Coast. This system promotes easy access to ocean data and supports the work of partners, researchers, industry, coastal communities, First Nations, and non-profits. We are committed to the development of a data management and dissemination approach to meet the needs of the regional marine community and contribute to global ocean observing. Connect with us to contribute to the effort. \n\nPartners\nPartnerships along the coast of British Columbia have been essential to observing the coastal ocean and this spirit continues in CIOOS Pacific. Academic, government, and non-profit organizations are founding members of CIOOS Pacific and we welcome additional organizations that will help elevate ocean monitoring on the coast. \n\nJoin the CIOOS Partnership\nData Management\nCIOOS believes in findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles and open access of ocean data. To ensure interoperability with other national and international data repositories we have adopted standards for metadata (or data about data) that will help data consumers understand the origins of the original observations. \n\nCIOOS Data Management Practices\nEssential Ocean Variables\nCIOOS captures a selection of essential ocean variables (EOVs) aligned with the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), contributing to global efforts to better understand the ocean, marine issues, and interactions with other earth systems. These EOVs are initial targets for ingestion into CIOOS and additional data types will be added as the system matures.

Europe and the United States have been leading the way, but following the Open Data Charter agreement at the 2013 G8 Summit, Japan also launched a national open data site ( DATA.GO.JP ), and advanced local governments have begun to actively work on open data.\n\nOpen data is expected to be put to effective use as a resource that will not run out even if the population or tax revenue declines, and in Europe and the United States, we are seeing many examples of its use, such as the efforts of NPOs that use open data to solve local issues and the success of venture companies that use open data. However, in Japan, the data has not yet been fully released, and as of March 2016, we have not yet reached that point.\n\nThere are still not many local governments working on open data. BODIK has released BODIK ODCS with the aim of supporting local governments in starting to work on open data, collecting open data from local governments, and building a social infrastructure that promotes the use of open data. We hope that this site will contribute to solving local issues and revitalizing the region.", "num_datasets": "0", "num_organizations": "0", "num_resources": 1}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-34.8848193, -8.0584933]}, "properties": {"id": "0b472b14-ec30-4588-8047-574c7bed4e46", "name": "ufpe-open-data-portal", "title": "UFPE Open Data Portal", "url": "https://dados.ufpe.br", "catalog_url": "https://ecosystem.ckan.org/site/ufpe-open-data-portal", "state": "active", "description": "The Federal University of Pernambuco Open Data Portal offers public data in an open format that can be freely accessed and used by all of society.

This is a catalog of the SAVeNoW project based on the \"Smart District Data Infrastructure\" (SDDI) concept. The concept is being developed at the Chair of Geoinformatics, Technical University of Munich (TUM). The assignment of datasets to groups, as well as the number and division of the groups themselves, is the result of long and intensive consideration. The division into three main groups enables a simple search for datasets, as well as an easily understandable assignment to specific subject areas. Links between individual datasets are possible through a special extension and facilitate navigation. Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) The catalog platform is part of the SDDI concept, which is used for data structuring in the area of Smart Cities and Regions. The idea of SDDI emerged in the course of the Europe-wide Smart Sustainable Districts project at the Chair of Geoinformatics at TUM, and is also the result of very long and extensive considerations. At the heart of the SDDI is the catalog platform, which manages the metadata of the individual datasets and provides an overview of the total inventory of all available data. The technical implementation of the catalog platform is based on the open-source software CKAN http://ckan.org/. For some of the functionalities, extensions are used, which partly come from the official CKAN extension library and partly were developed at the Chair of Geoinformatics at TUM. The catalog platform is operated in the backend via a PostgreSQL database http://postgresql.org/, which also enables the storage and processing of spatial data.

Created in 2019, this catalog was initially populated largely by the \"Parchemins\" (Paroles et chemins de l\u2019agriculture littorale \u2013 Words and Paths of Coastal Agriculture) research program, which primarily disseminates qualitative data from ethnographic and agronomic surveys conducted in Brittany between 2016 and 2020, as well as quantitative and spatialized data on the evolution of agriculture in Brittany. In 2020, data.agriculturelittorale.fr also disseminates part of the data from the \"Vivre avec l\u2019algue verte\" (Living with Green Algae) program collected during Alix Levain's doctoral research from 2010 to 2014 in Brittany (mainly extracts from municipal council deliberations of several municipalities in Finist\u00e8re and C\u00f4tes d\u2019Armor). The catalog is constantly evolving and intended to host new corpora from research programs documenting the relationships between agriculture and coastal areas. Any person or research program interested in depositing corpora in data.agriculturelittorale.fr is invited to contact the catalog administrator: data.agriculturelittorale[@]framalistes[point]org The catalog disseminates data of very diverse natures: quantitative corpora: for example, data on the evolution of the number of farms in a coastal area. spatialized data: for example, maps presenting studied sites, or the density of farms in a given territory. qualitative corpora: for example, extracts from municipal council deliberations of municipalities near the coast that mention decisions relating to agriculture, summaries of interviews conducted with farmers or residents of coastal regions, or photographs. The published data are subject to several licenses that define the terms of reuse of the disseminated content: either a public license (Licence Ouverte 2.0), or private licenses associated with research programs such as the Licence Parchemins. To consult data under private licenses, please follow the link indicated for each identified data set, which will put you in contact with the catalog administrators and the project concerned. The catalog offers several ways to explore the datasets: Data.agriculturelittorale.fr offers an indexing of content to facilitate the exploration of datasets by addressing different facets of the relationships between agriculture and the coastline: a series of keywords is associated with each data item, the list of which appears in the filter menu. When the source data is accessible under an open license, it can be viewed or downloaded via the \"Explore\" button. The data are described by metadata that gathers factual information (for example: format, collector, date, license, and associated project) and a description of the content (title, summary, keywords). The formats of the source files corresponding to each data item are diverse. They include text formats (.odt; .doc; .pdf), photo (.jpg), digitized document (.jpg; .pdf), cartographic (WMS; SHP), or sound (mp3). Who produces the datasets and populates the catalog? The data were collected by the \"collectors\" whose identity and contact information are mentioned in the metadata. In the vast majority of cases, these are researchers involved in a research project associated with the catalog. The collector owns the data that he/she has produced. They are processed (entered) by the \"editors\" (who may be the same as the collector) whose identity and contact information are mentioned in the metadata. They are affiliated with a research project mentioned in the \"organization\" box. The catalog is co-administered by UMR SAS (Unit\u00e9 mixte de recherche Sol, Agro et Hydrosyst\u00e8me, Spatialisation - Joint Research Unit Soil, Agro and Hydrosystem, Spatialization) and UMR AMURE (Centre de droit et \u00e9conomie de la mer - Center for Law and Economics of the Sea).

Some of this data was available before, but data.gov.uk brings it together in one searchable website. Making this data easily available means it will be easier for people to make decisions and suggestions about government policies based on detailed information. Hear more about the Government's Transparency agenda from the Prime Minister in this video. There are datasets available from all central government departments and a number of other public sector bodies and local authorities. Is data just public information? Not really. From data.gov.uk, you can access the raw data driving government forward. This can then be used by people to build useful applications that help society, or investigate how effective policy changes have been over time. General public information - such as how to find out if you are entitled to tax credits, or how to tax your car - can be found at gov.uk. You can use the data in all sorts of ways. This may be simply to analyse trends over time from one policy area, or to compare how different parts of government go about their work. Technical users will be able to create useful applications out of the raw data files, which can then be used by everyone. data.gov.uk provides a mini-site of guidance for publishers, including step-by-step process for including your data on data.gov.uk. Please see: Data.gov.uk is a key part of the Government's work on Transparency and Data. The data.gov.uk implementation is being led by the Data team in the Cabinet Office, working across government departments to ensure that data is released in a timely and accessible way. This work is being supported by Sir Tim-Berners Lee & Professor Nigel Shadbolt. There are a number of technical partners involved in the project to date. These include the CKAN, which runs the catalogue at data.gov.uk/data as well as a growing number of open data registries around the world. It is a project originally created by the Open Knowledge Foundation to make it easy to find, share and reuse open content and data. The CKAN software provides a web interface, programmer's API, feeds notifying of changes, and a browsable history of all changes. The API is documented here: http://data.gov.uk/datametadata-api-docs. There are a number of ways of getting involved in the project, dependent on your background or interest. For example: If you wish to get involved in working with data you can check this very brief primer, you can also check out organisations such as the Open Data Institute and the Open Knowledge Foundation.

The portal provides tools to manage collections of data with metadata published by units across multiple domains within FAO and outside including Partners, NGOs, private sector and space agencies. This portal helps users discover, understand and effectively use data assets. The FAO Agro-informatics Platform is a transformative digital initiative designed to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing access to the latest knowledge and resources. By integrating geospatial and statistical data, the platform facilitates targeted agricultural interventions, converting data into actionable information for sustainable agriculture. This approach not only supports various SDGs - such as poverty eradication, climate action, and hunger elimination - but also enhances the mobilization of finance, science, and policy mechanisms. Notable initiatives like the Hand-in-Hand Initiative benefit from this platform, improving agrifood systems and resilience, especially for vulnerable rural communities and smallholders. The platform has brought together over 20 FAO units across multiple domains, from Animal Health to Trade and Markets, integrating data from across FAO on Soil, Land, Water, Climate, Fisheries, Livestock, Crops, Forestry, Trade, Social and Economics, etc. Data has also been sourced from FAO partners and public data providers across the UN and NGOs, private sector and space agencies. So far, we have assembled a million geospatial layers, thousands of statistics series with 4,000 metadata records.

It serves as a central repository for open data and supports a variety of data formats and metadata used by the Agro-informatics Platform. Datasets are what users get from the catalog when searching for data, each of them identified by a unique fixed URL. A dataset is a parcel of data that includes information about the data or \u201cmetadata\u201d, and the related resource, which holds the data itself. A dataset can contain multiple resources, representing the same data in different formats or for different years. Data can be added as an upload from your computer or provided as a link to external sources on the web. An organization, in the FAO Agro-Informatics Data Catalog, is used to create, manage, and publish collections of datasets and to manage users. Organizations can be considered as entities that publish datasets. These entities may be a research institution either National or International, public and private sectors among others. Each organization is responsible for its own datasets and users to manage the dataset publication workflow. Users can have different roles within an organization, depending on their level of authorization to create, edit and publish information. Only system administrators can create a new organization in the FAO Agro-Informatics Data Catalog. Reach out to the team to assist you. You can register from the FAO Data Catalog portal by clicking on \u2018Log-in\u2019, on the top-right corner of the homepage. The registration process requests you to provide your email address (in lowercase) and your full name and password. Once the registration is complete, the platform will create your account and automatically log you in. Note that, registering to the platform does not automatically give you any special permission or authorization, which are indeed assigned by the admin of an organization. Learn more registration, login and password recovery here To be part of one or more organizations, you first need to be a registered user and then make the request to the contact person as indicated on the about page of the organization. You will be assigned to the organization with a role that reflects the level of authorization you need. Most of the datasets published in the FAO Agro-Informatics Data Catalog are publicly available. However, registered users assigned to one or more organizations can have access to private or unpublished datasets and may be assigned roles to create, manage and publish new datasets within their own organization(s). To share your data through the FAO Data Catalog portal, you need to be a registered user and added to an organization as an Editor or Admin. Dataset and DCAT metadata models are mainly used to describe statistical data (tables and spreadsheets) or to report collections of datasets and groups of layers. The ISO-19115 metadata model is the most appropriate schema to describe spatial data, particularly for raster and vector formats, and to link any type of associated resources to the metadata generated in the catalog. See the documentation for more information Yes, most datasets can be downloaded directly from their dataset page under Data and Resources. Click on the download link next to the resource you wish to download. If a dataset is restricted, you may need appropriate permissions or approval to access it. Data usage is typically governed by the license under which it is published. Each dataset page includes information about its license. Make sure to review the license to understand any restrictions or requirements for using the data. If you have questions about licensing, contact the dataset owner or our support team. If you encounter a bug or issue, please contact our support team ([email protected]) with detailed information about the problem. Providing screenshots and error messages can help us resolve the issue faster. \u00a9 FAO 2024.

At that time, cooperative auditing duties were the responsibility of the Cooperative Section, Department of Commerce and Statistics Forecasting, Ministry of the Royal Treasury. Later, with the restructuring of ministries and departments, it was elevated to the status of the Cooperative Auditing Department, under the Ministry of Cooperatives, on March 12, 2495 BE. Subsequently, it was transferred to the Ministry of National Development in 2506 BE. When the Ministry of National Development was dissolved in 2515 BE, the Cooperative Auditing Department was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, where it remains to this day. Originally, the cooperative auditing system involved all auditors being based at the Department's headquarters in Bangkok. They would travel to conduct audits in various provinces only once or twice a year, with each trip lasting approximately 60 to 90 days. This resulted in inefficient operations. In 2524 BE, the Cooperative Auditing Department began decentralizing auditing operations to the regions by establishing Provincial Cooperative Auditing Offices to provide closer assistance and advice on financial and accounting matters to agricultural institutions. Currently, the Cooperative Auditing Department has a Provincial Cooperative Auditing Office in every province throughout the country. Cooperative Auditing Offices 1-10 oversee the operations of the Provincial Cooperative Auditing Offices under their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n*Translated from Thai*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Original

CKAN (The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) was reached, a tool already adopted in the largest cities in the world, for the construction of this Open Data Portal, which gives even more transparency to municipal data. CKAN is free, open-source and specific for the development of data catalogs. Used by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Brazil and 139 other governments in the world, between national and local administrations, it was customized for the City of S\u00e3o Paulo by Prodam, the Information and Communication Technology Company of the Municipality, from the evolution of the work developed by the Municipal Comptroller General.

It allows users to search, access, visualize, and download data in various machine-readable formats, often through APIs, while also indicating licensing terms and data update frequencies. The catalogue also provides tools for data visualization and notifications for dataset updates.\n\n**About:**  \nThe Ontario government generates and maintains thousands of datasets. Since 2012, we have shared data with Ontarians via a data catalogue. Open data is data that is shared with the public. Click here to learn more about open data and why Ontario releases it. Ontario\u2019s Digital and Data Directive states that all data must be open, unless there is good reason for it to remain confidential. Ontario\u2019s Chief Digital and Data Officer also has the authority to make certain datasets available publicly. Datasets listed in the catalogue that are not open will have one of the following labels: If you want to use data you find in the catalogue, that data must have a licence \u2013 a set of rules that describes how you can use it. A licence: Most of the data available in the catalogue is released under Ontario\u2019s Open Government Licence. However, each dataset may be shared with the public under other kinds of licences or no licence at all. If a dataset doesn\u2019t have a licence, you don\u2019t have the right to use the data. If you have questions about how you can use a specific dataset, please contact us. The Ontario Data Catalogue endeavors to publish open data in a machine readable format. For machine readable datasets, you can simply retrieve the file you need using the file URL. The Ontario Data Catalogue is built on CKAN, which means the catalogue has the following features you can use when building applications. APIs (Application programming interfaces) let software applications communicate directly with each other. If you are using the catalogue in a software application, you might want to extract data from the catalogue through the catalogue API. Note: All Datastore API requests to the Ontario Data Catalogue must be made server-side. The catalogue's collection of dataset metadata (and dataset files) is searchable through the CKAN API. The Ontario Data Catalogue has more than just CKAN's documented search fields. You can also search these custom fields. You can also use the CKAN API to retrieve metadata about a particular dataset and check for updated files. Read the complete documentation for CKAN's API. Some of the open data in the Ontario Data Catalogue is available through the Datastore API. You can also search and access the machine-readable open data that is available in the catalogue. How to use the API feature: Read the complete documentation for CKAN's Datastore API. The Ontario Data Catalogue contains a record for each dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses. Some of these datasets will be available to you as open data. Others will not be available to you. This is because the Government of Ontario is unable to share data that would break the law or put someone's safety at risk. You can search for a dataset with a word that might describe a dataset or topic. Use words like \u201ctaxes\u201d or \u201chospital locations\u201d to discover what datasets the catalogue contains. You can search for a dataset from 3 spots on the catalogue: the homepage, the dataset search page, or the menu bar available across the catalogue. On the dataset search page, you can also filter your search results. You can select filters on the left hand side of the page to limit your search for datasets with your favourite file format, datasets that are updated weekly, datasets released by a particular ministry, or datasets that are released under a specific licence. Go to the dataset search page to see the filters that are available to make your search easier. You can also do a quick search by selecting one of the catalogue\u2019s categories on the homepage. These categories can help you see the types of data we have on key topic areas. When you find the dataset you are looking for, click on it to go to the dataset record. Each dataset record will tell you whether the data is available, and, if so, tell you about the data available. An open dataset might contain several data files. These files might represent different periods of time, different sub-sets of the dataset, different regions, language translations, or other breakdowns. You can select a file and either download it or preview it. Make sure to read the licence agreement to make sure you have permission to use it the way you want. A non-open dataset may be not available for many reasons. Read more about non-open data. Read more about restricted data. Data that is non-open may still be subject to freedom of information requests. The catalogue has tools that enable all users to visualize the data in the catalogue without leaving the catalogue \u2013 no additional software needed. Get automatic notifications when datasets are updated. You can choose to get notifications for individual datasets, an organization\u2019s datasets or the full catalogue. You don\u2019t have to provide and personal information \u2013 just subscribe to our feeds using any feed reader you like using the corresponding notification web addresses. Copy those addresses and paste them into your reader. Your feed reader will let you know when the catalogue has been updated. The catalogue provides open data in several file formats (e.g., spreadsheets, geospatial data, etc). Learn about each format and how you can access and use the data each file contains. A file that has a list of items and values separated by commas without formatting (e.g. colours, italics, etc.) or extra visual features. This format provides just the data that you would display in a table. XLSX (Excel) files may be converted to CSV so they can be opened in a text editor. How to access the data: Open with any spreadsheet software application (e.g., Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel) or text editor. Note: This format is considered machine-readable, it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Files that have visual formatting (e.g. bolded headers and colour-coded rows) can be hard for machines to understand, these elements make a file more human-readable and less machine-readable. A file that provides information without formatted text or extra visual features that may not follow a pattern of separated values like a CSV. How to access the data: Open with any word processor or text editor available on your device (e.g., Microsoft Word, Notepad). A spreadsheet file that may also include charts, graphs, and formatting. How to access the data: Open with a spreadsheet software application that supports this format (e.g., Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel). Data can be converted to a CSV for a non-proprietary format of the same data without formatted text or extra visual features. A shapefile provides geographic information that can be used to create a map or perform geospatial analysis based on location, points/lines and other data about the shape and features of the area. It includes required files (.shp, .shx, .dbt) and might include corresponding files (e.g., .prj). How to access the data: Open with a geographic information system (GIS) software program (e.g., QGIS). A package of files and folders. The package can contain any number of different file types. How to access the data: Open with an unzipping software application (e.g., WinZIP, 7Zip). Note: If a ZIP file contains .shp, .shx, and .dbt file types, it is an ArcGIS ZIP: a package of shapefiles which provide information to create maps or perform geospatial analysis that can be opened with ArcGIS (a geographic information system software program). A file that provides information related to a geographic area (e.g., phone number, address, average rainfall, number of owl sightings in 2011 etc.) and its geospatial location (i.e., points/lines). How to access the data: Open using a GIS software application to create a map or do geospatial analysis. It can also be opened with a text editor to view raw information. Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A text-based format for sharing data in a machine-readable way that can store data with more unconventional structures such as complex lists. How to access the data: Open with any text editor (e.g., Notepad) or access through a browser. Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A text-based format to store and organize data in a machine-readable way that can store data with more unconventional structures (not just data organized in tables). How to access the data: Open with any text editor (e.g., Notepad). Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. A file that provides information related to an area (e.g., phone number, address, average rainfall, number of owl sightings in 2011 etc.) and its geospatial location (i.e., points/lines). How to access the data: Open with a geospatial software application that supports the KML format (e.g., Google Earth). Note: This format is machine-readable, and it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Human-readable data (including visual formatting) is easy for users to read and understand. This format contains files with data from tables used for statistical analysis and data visualization of Statistics Canada census data. How to access the data: Open with the Beyond 20/20 application. A database which links and combines data from different files or applications (including HTML, XML, Excel, etc.). The database file can be converted to a CSV/TXT to make the data machine-readable, but human-readable formatting will be lost. How to access the data: Open with Microsoft Office Access (a database management system used to develop application software). A file that keeps the original layout and formatting of a page. The contents of a PDF cannot be edited directly. How to access the data: Open with web browsers, PDF readers, and word processors. A text file which can include images, tables and many other formatting options. How to access the data: Open with doc/docx compatible word processors. A text file which can include basic text formatting and images. How to access the data: Opens with most word processors (e.g., OpenOffice). Open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will vary in how it is organized and formatted. Depending on the licence agreement for a dataset, you can choose to organize and format the file to suit your intended use. Some of the open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will have a data dictionary. A data dictionary can help you understand what the dataset means. If you need further understanding the data, reach out to the dataset point of contact. Each dataset listed in the catalogue might have the following details as part of its description: A unique set of numbers and letters.

The objective of this portal is to promote the reuse as well as improve the dissemination of statistical information to the users of statistical data of Cantabria by means of tools based on standards adopted internationally. What is open data? According to DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/1024 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 June 2019, open data is data in open formats that can be freely used, reused and shared by anyone for any purpose. What is reuse? Reuse is the use of documents held by public sector administrations and bodies, by natural or legal persons, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that such use does not constitute a public administrative activity. The exchange of documents between public sector administrations and bodies in the exercise of their assigned public functions is excluded from this concept. What are its benefits? As recognized by Law 37/2007, of November 16, on the reuse of public sector information, the information generated from public bodies is of great importance and value due to the interest it has for companies and, consequently, for economic growth and job creation. Likewise, the interest of the aforementioned information for citizens is pointed out, as an element of transparency and a guide for democratic participation. What is the applicable legal framework? Directive 2003/98/EC, of November 17, 2003, on the reuse of public sector information Law 37/2007, of November 16, on the reuse of public sector information Royal Decree 1495/2011, of October 24, which develops Law 37/2007, of November 16, on the reuse of public sector information, for the scope of the state public sector Resolution of February 19, 2013, of the Secretary of State for Public Administrations, which approves the Technical Standard of Interoperability for the Reuse of Information Resources Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 26, 2013, amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the reuse of public sector information Law 18/2015, of July 9, amending Law 37/2007, of November 16, on the reuse of public sector information Directive (EU) 2019/1024, of June 20, 2019, on open data and the reuse of public sector information What are the conditions for reusing datos.icane.es data? The conditions for reuse can be found on the Legal Notice page of the Cantabrian Institute of Statistics, an agency dependent on the Government of Cantabria in charge of the production and dissemination of statistics on all aspects of society and the economy of the Autonomous Community. What personal data is displayed? datos.icane.es does not display personal data or data that could identify specific individuals in the terms of the provisions of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights. What to do in case of incidents or doubts? You can send your suggestions, questions or notifications of problems through the Mailbox of the Cantabrian Institute of Statistics or the data request on the website of the Cantabrian Institute of Statistics. How can I access the published data? There are several ways to access the data published in the catalog: Through the search engine on the main page or the popular tags and highlighted groups of the data catalog From the list of data sets produced by CKAN through its API, or through an RDF browser. What is CKAN? CKAN, from the English Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network, is the world's leading solution in opensource platforms for open data portals, developed and maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to finding solutions to the technical and social problems offered by the opening of data and knowledge. While the main international reference is the open data portal of the United Kingdom, it is also used to implement the open data catalogs of the Governments of the United States of America, Australia, the autonomous community of Aragon and the cities of Berlin or Santander. Similarly, it is used by The DataHub, a hub where data sets can be freely registered or uploaded, used by multiple organizations, including The British Library and the scientific journal Nature. In addition to being free, being open source software, it is highly flexible, avoiding dependencies on unique providers and allowing its adaptation to the needs of the Public Administration. It also provides a wide range of functions for data management, including data cataloging, data governance, data quality control, data workflows, and data and metadata backup and recovery that allow extending the catalog of products and services currently offered by the Cantabrian Institute of Statistics.\n\n*Translated from Spanish*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**  \nCat\u00e1logo de Informaci\u00f3n Estad\u00edstica P\u00fablica de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Cantabria datos.icane.es es el repositorio de datos estad\u00edsticos abiertos y enlazados de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Cantabria, donde se ofrece una organizaci\u00f3n alternativa de la informaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica disponible en www.icane.es.

It aims to foster innovation and economic growth by enabling the creative reuse of public information for solving common problems and developing new services. The catalog is managed by a project group and utilizes the CKAN open-source software for data cataloging, encouraging collaboration and feedback from the public.\n\n**About:**  \nPublic administrations share a common characteristic: they produce, manage, and accumulate data as a result of their normal operations. Some data are subject to specific constraints, such as privacy protection, national security, or intellectual property. Others, however, can be freely disseminated and reused by everyone. Information relating to cycle paths or the location of local products can stimulate the development of innovative services for tourists, families, and citizens. Information relating to public transport and the road network can allow for the optimization of services from the bottom up through feedback sent by the users themselves. Data relating to public events and the weather allow the creation of applications capable of further increasing the visibility of events, as well as allowing better organization by participants. This information has great economic value and strong potential for innovative growth: opening public data means creating new opportunities for the territory, based on their creative reuse, proposing and inventing new solutions to common problems, without burdening the activities of the public administration. The Open Data catalog of South Tyrol makes this data available, promoting its reuse both in a technological and legal sense. It contains datasets provided by all the institutional actors of the South Tyrol system, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, local authorities, system companies and, more generally, by all actors interested in participating in this process. The catalog is managed and implemented by a project group composed of experts in the various thematic areas involved (such as data collection, analysis and modeling, the semantics and legal correctness of the opening process, the organizational impact). The working group is coordinated by the Managerial Position in Information Technology of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, which is the provincial structure indicated by the Provincial Council as competent for the Open Data Project in South Tyrol. The site is based on open-source data cataloging software called CKAN, developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation: a non-profit organization that promotes free knowledge. Each entry contains a description of the data (metadata) and other useful information, such as the available formats, the holder, the freedom of access and reuse, and the topics that the data address. CKAN, used for various data catalogs on the internet, converges in The Data Hub: a centrally modifiable and reusable collector, in the style of Wikipedia. The level of innovation that the liberation of data achieves is remarkable: already the opening of a simple data point by a public structure is a great result in terms of organizational change towards the culture of data and the knowledge economy. For this reason, the catalog is constantly evolving: starting from the opening of data, connections are created that will lead to a change in the way of thinking and working, in the public and private sectors alike: from data as a private resource for management purposes to data as a \"public good\" for public and social purposes. Public sector information is seen as a basic platform whose applications are yet to be written. This enormous change, in order to be realized, also needs you.

Alcuni dati sono soggetti a precisi vincoli, quali ad esempio la tutela della privacy, la sicurezza nazionale o la propriet\u00e0 intellettuale. Altri invece possono essere liberamente diffusi e riutilizzati da tutti. Le informazioni relative a piste ciclabili, la localizzazione dei prodotti locali possono stimolare lo sviluppo di servizi innovativi per il turista, le famiglie, il cittadino. Le informazioni relative ai trasporti pubblici e al grafo stradale possono consentire una ottimizzazione dei servizi dal basso mediante un feedback inviato dagli stessi utenti. I dati relativi alle manifestazioni pubbliche e al meteo consentono la creazione di applicazioni capaci di aumentare ancora pi\u00f9 visibilit\u00e0 agli eventi, oltre a consentirne una migliore organizzazione da parte dei partecipanti. Queste informazioni possiedono un grande valore economico e un forte potenziale di crescita innovativa: aprire i dati pubblici significa creare nuove opportunit\u00e0 per il territorio, basate sul loro riutilizzo creativo, proponendo e inventando nuove soluzioni a problemi comuni, senza aggravio per le attivit\u00e0 della pubblica amministrazione. Il catalogo Open Data dell'Alto Adige mette a disposizione questi dati, favorendone il riutilizzo sia in senso tecnologico che giuridico. Contiene dataset forniti da tutti gli attori istituzionali del sistema Alto Adige, Provincia autonoma di Bolzano, gli Enti locali, le societ\u00e0 di sistema e, pi\u00f9 in generale, da tutti gli attori interessati a partecipare a questo processo. Il catalogo \u00e8 gestito e implementato da un gruppo di progetto composto da esperti nelle diverse aree tematiche coinvolte (quali la raccolta, l'analisi e la modellazione dei dati, la semantica e correttezza giuridica del processo di apertura, l\u2019impatto organizzativo). Il gruppo di lavoro \u00e8 coordinato dall'Incarico dirigenziale in materia di Informatica della Provincia autonoma di Bolzano che \u00e8 la struttura provinciale indicata dalla Giunta Provinciale come competente per il Progetto Open data in Alto Adige. Il sito \u00e8 basato su un software open-source di catalogazione dei dati, chiamato CKAN, sviluppato dalla Open Knowledge Foundation: un'organizzazione no-profit che promuove il sapere libero. Ogni voce contiene una descrizione dei dati (metadati) e altre informazioni utili, come i formati disponibili, il detentore, la libert\u00e0 di accesso e riuso, e gli argomenti che i dati affrontano. CKAN, utilizzato per diversi cataloghi di dati su internet, converge in The Data Hub: un raccoglitore centrale liberamente modificabile e riutilizzabile, nello stile di Wikipedia. Il livello di innovazione che realizza la liberazione dei dati \u00e8 notevole: gi\u00e0 solo l'apertura di un semplice dato da parte di una struttura pubblica \u00e8 un grande risultato in termini di cambiamento organizzativo in direzione della cultura del dato e dell\u2019economia della conoscenza. Per questo, il catalogo \u00e8 in continua evoluzione: partendo dall'apertura dei dati si creano connessioni che porteranno ad un cambiamento nel modo di pensare e di lavorare, nel settore pubblico come in quello privato: dal dato come risorsa privata per scopi gestionali al dato come \"bene pubblico\" per scopi pubblici e sociali. L'informazione del settore pubblico \u00e8 vista come una piattaforma di base le cui applicazioni sono ancora da scrivere. Questo enorme cambiamento, per potersi realizzare, ha bisogno anche di voi.

It establishes a Government Data Catalog and Directory Services to facilitate data sharing and accessibility among government agencies and the public. The Department of Mental Health is a pilot agency, preparing key mental health data for the CKAN platform to enhance public access.\n\n**About:**  \nAccording to the Digital Government Act B.E. 2562 (2019), government agencies are required to manage public administration and provide public services in a convenient, fast, efficient, and responsive manner to the public, as well as to manage and integrate government data and operations in a consistent and secure manner. Therefore, it is necessary to establish government data governance for principles and guidelines in operations, resulting in the development of important government data systems for defining guidelines and principles for linking, exchanging, and integrating data of government agencies systematically. This development will lead to a central government open data portal, allowing the public to access and utilize it effectively. On November 18, 2020, the National Statistical Office invited agencies to participate as pilot agencies in the study and development of a prototype Government Data Catalog and Directory Services to enhance knowledge and gather opinions on the approach to driving the creation of a government data catalog. This will serve as a prototype for a central government data catalog and directory services that data users in both central and regional government agencies can efficiently search for and access data. The Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health, accepted to be a pilot agency in creating the Government Data Catalog and Directory Services, with 31 departmental-level agencies participating as pilots. On December 3, 2020, the National Statistical Office invited the Department of Mental Health to attend a meeting to explain the study and development project for a prototype Government Data Catalog and Directory Services. The National Statistical Office instructed the pilot agencies to: 1. Appoint a Data Governance Committee for the Department of Mental Health. 2. Appoint a Data Steward Team for the Department of Mental Health. 3. Prepare data and resources to be piloted in accordance with the agency's core mission, with at least one mission, to install and activate the agency's CKAN platform. On December 18, 2020, the National Statistical Office attended a meeting to explain the operational guidelines at the Department of Mental Health. The Department of Mental Health was instructed to prepare the Government Data Catalog and Directory Services in the area of mental health, considering and analyzing mental health data that is important to the organization and aligns with the vision, mission, values, and core missions, according to the defined platform, and will be uploaded to the system (CKAN) for public access to government data in the future.\n\n*Translated from Thai*\n\n---\n\n**Original Text:**
